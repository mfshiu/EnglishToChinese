1929 or 1989?	我是中文句子
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a diffusion of the effort (the United States).	我是中文句子
For geo-strategists, however, the year that naturally comes to mind, in both politics and economics, is 1989.	我是中文句子
Of course, the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall.	我是中文句子
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points.	我是中文句子
In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc.	我是中文句子
Of course, there are obvious differences between 1989 and now.	我是中文句子
First, and perhaps above all, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity.	我是中文句子
By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity, but with China substituting for the Soviet Union.	我是中文句子
Second, whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989, it is difficult in 2009, with the spread of the global crisis, to distinguish winners from losers.	我是中文句子
In better shape, but not alone.	我是中文句子
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes.	我是中文句子
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe.	我是中文句子
But before this new order appears, the world may be faced with spreading disorder, if not outright chaos.	我是中文句子
When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer.	我是中文句子
The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers, including me, would have assumed.	我是中文句子
One Hundred Years of Ineptitude	我是中文句子
It not only put financial markets and currencies at risk; it also exposed serious regulatory and governance shortcomings that have yet to be fully addressed.	我是中文句子
However serious those crises turn out to be, historians a century from now will likely despair at our shortsightedness.	我是中文句子
They will note that analysts and regulators were narrowly focused on fixing the financial system by strengthening national oversight regimes.	我是中文句子
While this was a worthy goal, historians will point out, it was far from the only imperative.	我是中文句子
Yet not nearly enough has been invested in this effort.	我是中文句子
Beyond regional bodies like the European Union, international financial governance has remained largely untouched.	我是中文句子
Major technological advances fueled by cheap money can cause markets to change so fast that policy and institutional change cannot keep up.	我是中文句子
This is what happened in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.	我是中文句子
New technology-enabled financial instruments created opportunities for some to make huge amounts of money.	我是中文句子
But regulators were unable to keep up with the innovations, which ended up generating risks that affected the entire economy.	我是中文句子
This points to a fundamental difference between global crises of the twenty-first century and, say, the Great Depression in the 1930s or, indeed, any past stock-market crashes.	我是中文句子
Because of the financial sector’s growth, more actors benefit from under-regulation and weak governance in the short term, making today’s crises more difficult to prevent.	我是中文句子
Complicating matters further, the systems affected by today’s crises extend well beyond any one regulatory body’s jurisdiction.	我是中文句子
The 2008 crisis cast a harsh spotlight on just how bad we are at responding quickly to disasters, especially those fueled by fragmented governance.	我是中文句子
Moreover, we should ensure that we provide international institutions with the needed resources and responsibilities.	我是中文句子
And by punishing those who exacerbate risks for the sake of their own interests, we would strengthen the legitimacy of global governance and the institutions that are meant to conduct it.	我是中文句子
As it stands, inadequate cross-border coordination and enforcement of international agreements is a major impediment to crisis prevention and management.	我是中文句子
Yet, far from addressing this weakness, the world is reviving an outdated model of national sovereignty that makes crises of various kinds more likely.	我是中文句子
Unless we change course soon, the world of 2118 will have much reason to regard us with scorn.	我是中文句子
What Failed in 2008?	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – To solve a problem, it is not enough to know what to do.	我是中文句子
You actually have to implement the solution – and be willing to change course if it turns out that you did not know quite as much as you thought.	我是中文句子
As a result, markets were deregulated, making it easier to trade assets that were perceived to be safe, but were in fact not.	我是中文句子
As a result, systemic risk proliferated beyond central bankers’ wildest imagination.	我是中文句子
Untested – and ultimately incorrect – assumptions created a policymaking environment defined by what can only be called hubris.	我是中文句子
Officials underestimated tail risks.	我是中文句子
They set inflation targets at around 2% – leaving little room for maneuver when the water got choppy.	我是中文句子
And, most audaciously of all, the European Union introduced the euro as a common currency.	我是中文句子
Indeed, wrongheaded policymaking continued long after the crisis began.	我是中文句子
Wolf’s prescription for countering the crisis is simple, smart, and unassailable.	我是中文句子
In the short term, he suggests that countries with reserve currencies spend more (especially to finance public-sector investments) and issue more debt.	我是中文句子
Their central banks, he argues, should raise inflation targets to 3% or even 4% per year.	我是中文句子
Over the medium term, according to Wolf, countries need to put in place regulatory measures that lower debt levels and discourage overleveraging.	我是中文句子
And yet, as recommendable as Wolf’s proposals may be, little has been done to implement them.	我是中文句子
When the 2008 financial crisis erupted, policymakers tried to apply Friedman’s proposed solutions to the Great Depression.	我是中文句子
The result is today’s stagnant economy, marked by anemic growth that threatens to become the new normal.	我是中文句子
The United States and Europe are on track to have thrown away 10% of their potential wealth, while the failure to strengthen financial-sector regulation has left the world economy exposed to the risk of another major crisis.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the only true lesson of the crisis so far seems to be that its lessons will never truly be learned.	我是中文句子
A Comeback Strategy for Europe	我是中文句子
Admittedly, the pope’s characterization was alarmingly accurate in some respects.	我是中文句子
But, despite its seeming lassitude, Europe retains significant strengths.	我是中文句子
But the world is changing: the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly influencing global developments, economic and otherwise.	我是中文句子
Though the TPP faces no shortage of hurdles to clear before an agreement is finalized, its potential to augment Asia’s economic power cannot be underestimated.	我是中文句子
Europe must work to secure its position in the new world order – beginning by enhancing its own trade and investment ties with the US.	我是中文句子
(If the TTIP was opened to other economies – such as Turkey, Mexico, and Canada – the benefits would be even greater.)	我是中文句子
Even more compelling than the benefits of achieving an agreement, though, are the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the perception that the EU’s internal squabbles had led it to squander a strategic opportunity would probably drive the US to accelerate its disengagement from the continent.	我是中文句子
And Russian President Vladimir Putin would invariably regard the EU’s failure as a major opportunity to exert more influence over parts of Europe.	我是中文句子
When the TTIP was first proposed, Europe seemed to recognize its value.	我是中文句子
Indeed, it was the EU that pushed the US, which initially doubted Europe’s commitment, to launch the negotiation process in June 2013.	我是中文句子
The ambition was to complete the negotiations on “one tank of gas.”	我是中文句子
No one wanted to endure protracted talks – or the associated political pain.	我是中文句子
But EU leaders essentially abandoned the project, seemingly confirming American fears.	我是中文句子
And they must revive their commitment to conclude the talks successfully in 2015.	我是中文句子
This is not to say that resolving the remaining issues in the TTIP negotiations will be simple.	我是中文句子
The fact is that the challenges inherent in completing the TTIP are no more intractable than those that EU leaders have faced in the last few years of crisis.	我是中文句子
When the TTIP negotiations resume next month, EU leaders must push for genuine progress, with the goal of completing a deal by the end of the year.	我是中文句子
The good news is that the recent midterm elections in the US might have improved their chances.	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama now might get so-called fast-track negotiating authority from Congress.	我是中文句子
If he does, Congress would simply approve or reject any negotiated agreement, rather than picking it apart.	我是中文句子
The US presidential election season is starting, and other issues in the new year could easily take over the EU agenda.	我是中文句子
That is why Europe’s leaders have no time to waste.	我是中文句子
They must seize economic opportunity – and avert strategic disaster.	我是中文句子
The Year That Ended an Epoch?	我是中文句子
MADRID – As 2016 comes to an end, the outlook for 2017 is shrouded in uncertainty.	我是中文句子
Tensions in the Middle East are rising, and populist movements have appeared in Europe and the United States.	我是中文句子
The world’s priority for the coming year must be to achieve peace in Syria, which will require close regional and international cooperation.	我是中文句子
On December 27, Iran, Russia, and Turkey will hold a tripartite meeting in Moscow to discuss a political solution for the Syria conflict.	我是中文句子
That meeting, if it takes place, is likely to be overshadowed by the fallout from the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey.	我是中文句子
But it is nothing if not surprising that these parties, and not the US and the European Union, would be negotiating such an agreement.	我是中文句子
One positive development this year came in March, when the EU and Turkey signed an agreement to address the refugee crisis.	我是中文句子
Turkey has now taken in some three million Syrian refugees since the beginning of the conflict.	我是中文句子
European politics next year, meanwhile, will be consumed by the Brexit negotiations.	我是中文句子
In March, the United Kingdom will likely invoke Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, triggering the formal procedure for withdrawal from the EU.	我是中文句子
The challenge will be to reach an agreement that guarantees the wellbeing of future EU-UK relations.	我是中文句子
This will not be easy, and EU negotiators have already set a timeline of only 18 months.	我是中文句子
In 2017, several European countries will hold general elections, and there is a risk that isolationist, anti-European populist movements will make a strong showing.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, many Europeans’ views toward the EU actually improved in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.	我是中文句子
But this will not lessen the challenge for EU governments in the year ahead.	我是中文句子
They must unite societies divided by powerful global forces, such as globalization and rapid technological innovation.	我是中文句子
The Brexit referendum, followed by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, signaled the rise of populism in the West.	我是中文句子
This holds peril for US-EU relations.	我是中文句子
In previous years, the Paris climate agreement and the nuclear agreement with Iran were rays of light in a world closing itself off to multilateralism.	我是中文句子
In the coming years, such rays may become scarcer still.	我是中文句子
Now more than ever, we need the kind of dialogue that builds strategic trust between great powers.	我是中文句子
And yet, Trump’s statements casting doubt on continued US adherence to a “One China” policy vis-à-vis Taiwan could severely damage relations between the world’s two largest economies.	我是中文句子
The coming year will be particularly important for Europe.	我是中文句子
Relations between the EU and the US must remain strong, rooted in mutual respect for democracy, freedom, and human rights.	我是中文句子
After a turbulent 2016, and with little positive news in international politics, 2017 is shaping up to be a year of challenges and uncertainty.	我是中文句子
But the biggest uncertainty of all is whether this is simply the end of another year, or the end of a geopolitical epoch.	我是中文句子
Another Slow Year for the Global Economy	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – Last April, the International Monetary Fund projected that the world economy would grow by 3.5% in 2015.	我是中文句子
In the ensuing months, that forecast was steadily whittled down, reaching 3.1% in October.	我是中文句子
But the IMF continues to insist – as it has, with almost banal predictability, for the last seven years – that next year will be better.	我是中文句子
But it is almost certainly wrong yet again.	我是中文句子
For starters, world trade is growing at an anemic annual rate of 2%, compared to 8% from 2003 to 2007.	我是中文句子
Even if GDP growth outstrips growth in trade this year, it will likely amount to no more than 2.7%.	我是中文句子
The question is why.	我是中文句子
And, indeed, the financial dislocations of 2007-2008 have largely receded.	我是中文句子
So what accounts for the sluggish economic recovery?	我是中文句子
But demand would remain weak only if people lacked confidence in the future.	我是中文句子
Before the crisis – and especially from 2003 to 2007 – slow productivity growth was being obscured by an illusory sense of prosperity in much of the world.	我是中文句子
In some countries – notably, the United States, Spain, and Ireland – rising real-estate prices, speculative construction, and financial risk-taking were mutually reinforcing.	我是中文句子
At the same time, countries were amplifying one another’s growth through trade.	我是中文句子
Central to the global boom was China, the rising giant that flooded the world with cheap exports, putting a lid on global inflation.	我是中文句子
This dynamic reversed around March 2008, when the US rescued its fifth-largest investment bank, Bear Sterns, from collapse.	我是中文句子
With the eurozone banks also deeply implicated in the subprime mortgage mess and desperately short of US dollars, America and much of Europe began a remorseless slide into recession.	我是中文句子
Whereas in the boom years, world trade had spread the bounty, it was now spreading the malaise.	我是中文句子
As each country’s GDP growth slowed, so did its imports, causing its trading partners’ growth to slow as well.	我是中文句子
The US economy began to emerge from its recession in the second half of 2009, thanks largely to aggressive monetary policy and steps to stabilize the financial system.	我是中文句子
Eurozone policymakers, by contrast, rejected monetary stimulus and implemented fiscal austerity measures, while ignoring the deepening distress of their banks.	我是中文句子
The eurozone thus pushed the world into a second global recession.	我是中文句子
Just when that recession seemed to have run its course, emerging economies began to unravel.	我是中文句子
For years, observers had been touting the governance and growth-enhancing reforms that these countries’ leaders had supposedly introduced.	我是中文句子
In October 2012, the IMF celebrated emerging economies’ “resilience.”	我是中文句子
These problems are now being compounded by the growth slowdown in China, the fulcrum of global trade.	我是中文句子
And the worst is yet to come.	我是中文句子
In short, the factors that dragged down the global economy in 2015 will persist – and in some cases even intensify – in the new year.	我是中文句子
Emerging economies will remain weak.	我是中文句子
The eurozone, having enjoyed a temporary reprieve from austerity, will be constrained by listless global trade.	我是中文句子
Rising interest rates on corporate bonds portend slower growth in the US.	我是中文句子
China’s collapsing asset values could trigger financial turbulence.	我是中文句子
And policymakers are adrift, with little political leverage to stem these trends.	我是中文句子
Such an effort is long overdue.	我是中文句子
Trumpian Uncertainty	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Every January, I try to craft a forecast for the coming year.	我是中文句子
In making these forecasts, I have relied more on analysis of underlying economic forces than on complex econometric models.	我是中文句子
For example, at the beginning of 2016, it seemed clear that the deficiencies of global aggregate demand that have been manifest for the last several years were unlikely to change dramatically.	我是中文句子
Thus, I thought that forecasters of a stronger recovery were looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses. Economic developments unfolded much as I anticipated.	我是中文句子
Not so the political events of 2016.	我是中文句子
But inequality continued to worsen – with striking data showing that average life expectancy in the US was on the decline.	我是中文句子
And while America might be at the extreme of this trend, things were little better elsewhere.	我是中文句子
But, if it seemed clear that there would be political consequences, their form and timing were far less obvious.	我是中文句子
Why did the backlash in the US come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend, rather than earlier?	我是中文句子
And why did it manifest itself in a lurch to the right?	我是中文句子
And why was the victor somebody who made his living from taking advantage of others, openly admitted not paying his fair share of taxes, and made tax avoidance a point of pride?	我是中文句子
Donald Trump grasped the spirit of the time: things weren’t going well, and many voters wanted change.	我是中文句子
Now they will get it: there will be no business as usual. But seldom has there been more uncertainty.	我是中文句子
Which policies Trump will pursue remains unknown, to say nothing of which will succeed or what the consequences will be.	我是中文句子
Trump seems hell-bent on having a trade war.	我是中文句子
But how will China and Mexico respond?	我是中文句子
Trump may well understand that what he proposes will violate World Trade Organization rules, but he may also know that it will take a long time for the WTO to rule against him.	我是中文句子
And by then, America’s trade account may have been rebalanced.	我是中文句子
But two can play that game: China can take similar actions, though its response is likely to be more subtle.	我是中文句子
If a trade war were to break out, what would happen?	我是中文句子
Trump may have reason to think he could win; after all, China is more dependent on exports to the US than the US is on exports to China, which gives the US an advantage.	我是中文句子
But a trade war is not a zero-sum game. The US stands to lose as well.	我是中文句子
China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain.	我是中文句子
And the Chinese may be in a better position to respond to US attempts to inflict pain on them than the US is to respond to the pain that China might inflict on Americans.	我是中文句子
It’s anybody’s guess who can stand the pain better.	我是中文句子
Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?	我是中文句子
Fire-breathing rhetoric, or raving three a.m. tweets, may assuage the anger of those left behind by the Reagan revolution, at least for a while.	我是中文句子
But for how long?	我是中文句子
And what happens then?	我是中文句子
Trump might like to repeal the ordinary laws of economics, as he goes about his version of voodoo economics. But he can’t.	我是中文句子
9/11 and the New Authoritarianism	我是中文句子
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, “9/11” is no longer a mere date.	我是中文句子
It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new, a new era perhaps, but in any case a time of change.	我是中文句子
But was it really a war that started on September 11, 2001?	我是中文句子
Not all are happy about this American notion.	我是中文句子
During the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK, successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged.	我是中文句子
This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts, which are more correctly described as criminal.	我是中文句子
Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”	我是中文句子
The world now wonders how many more of these non-human humans are there in how many places.	我是中文句子
For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights.	我是中文句子
Controls at borders have become an ordeal for many, and police persecution now burdens quite a few.	我是中文句子
A climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously, notably for Muslims.	我是中文句子
Such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, by and large it was the critics, not the supporters, of these measures who found themselves in trouble.	我是中文句子
In Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely, the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory.	我是中文句子
Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom.	我是中文句子
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.	我是中文句子
The problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism, though in many it has not become quite as specific.	我是中文句子
In most countries of continental Europe, “9/11” has remained an American date.	我是中文句子
There is even a debate – and indeed some evidence – concerning the question of whether involvement in the “war against terrorism” has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts.	我是中文句子
Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible.	我是中文句子
This stance, however, has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages, too: Angst .	我是中文句子
A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground.	我是中文句子
People feel uneasy and worried, especially when traveling.	我是中文句子
Any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism.	我是中文句子
Thus, 9/11 has meant, directly or indirectly, a great shock, both psychologically and to our political systems.	我是中文句子
One of the worrying features of the 9/11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators’ resentment of the West and its ways.	我是中文句子
Two steps, above all, are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9/11.	我是中文句子
First, we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary.	我是中文句子
Second, and more importantly, our leaders must seek to calm, rather than exploit, public anxiety.	我是中文句子
The terrorists with whom we are currently at “war” cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy.	我是中文句子
That is all the more reason for democrats to stand tall in defending our values – first and foremost by acting in accordance with them.	我是中文句子
9/11 in Perspective	我是中文句子
September 11, 2001, was a terrible tragedy by any measure, but it was not a historical turning point.	我是中文句子
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed, or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace. On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated.	我是中文句子
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world.	我是中文句子
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best.	我是中文句子
They can destroy but not create.	我是中文句子
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.	我是中文句子
Moreover, measures have been implemented to push back, successfully, against terrorists.	我是中文句子
Intelligence assets have been redirected. Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient.	我是中文句子
Military force has played a role as well.	我是中文句子
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power.	我是中文句子
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad.	我是中文句子
Drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists, including many of the most important leaders.	我是中文句子
Weak governments can be made stronger; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable.	我是中文句子
But progress is not to be confused with victory.	我是中文句子
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.	我是中文句子
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of political goals.	我是中文句子
Indeed, terrorists are advancing in some areas.	我是中文句子
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world’s other most dangerous terrorists.	我是中文句子
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones.	我是中文句子
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism.	我是中文句子
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US.	我是中文句子
The Internet, one of the great inventions of the modern Western world, has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world.	我是中文句子
All things being equal, we probably are.	我是中文句子
What is to be done?	我是中文句子
Alas, there is no single or silver bullet.	我是中文句子
Reducing unemployment is desirable, of course, but many terrorists do not come from poverty.	我是中文句子
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse, but this is easier said than done.	我是中文句子
Of course, we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so.	我是中文句子
But what may be most important, particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities, is to end any acceptance of terrorism.	我是中文句子
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency.	我是中文句子
Transatlantic Trade for All	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – The negotiations to create a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States are being widely welcomed.	我是中文句子
But there is a serious downside: The deal could hurt developing-country exporters, unless the EU and the US make a concerted effort to protect these actors’ interests.	我是中文句子
Given low tariffs in the EU and the US – less than 5%, on average – further preferential reductions will not seriously handicap outsiders.	我是中文句子
The first option would enable producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale.	我是中文句子
But, in some cases, the harmonized standard could be more stringent than some countries’ original standards.	我是中文句子
If the policy were extended to third-country firms, it would have a powerful liberalizing impact.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, when it comes to tariffs and standards, WTO rules are not created equal.	我是中文句子
Even in the absence of international rules, the EU and the US could take two actions to ensure that the TTIP does not have adverse consequences for developing economies.	我是中文句子
First, they could allow all countries to reap the benefits of a bilateral mutual-recognition deal by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin.	我是中文句子
This is akin to a WTO test for departures from established international standards.	我是中文句子
If the EU and the US made these two commitments, the rest of the world could follow the TTIP negotiations with hope, rather than trepidation.	我是中文句子
A Balanced Look at Sino-American Imbalances	我是中文句子
In particular, they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt.	我是中文句子
Of course, the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability.	我是中文句子
But all parts of a country’s total debt and how it is financed are interconnected.	我是中文句子
Second, troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components.	我是中文句子
After the subprime crisis erupted, mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default.	我是中文句子
Indeed, America’s current-account position strengthened despite the dollar’s appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, slid into recession.	我是中文句子
To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth, the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.	我是中文句子
The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt.	我是中文句子
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.	我是中文句子
But where will increased competitiveness come from?	我是中文句子
Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run, but it is not a solution.	我是中文句子
If foreign financing is not forthcoming, yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession.	我是中文句子
In the long run, America’s growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation.	我是中文句子
But neither improved competitiveness, nor reduction of total debt, can be achieved overnight.	我是中文句子
In the short run, the US current-account deficit will remain, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses.	我是中文句子
Thus, China’s continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability.	我是中文句子
That augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy.	我是中文句子
A Banking Union Baby Step	我是中文句子
At the time (2008-2009), large international banks had to be rescued by their home countries’ governments when they ran into trouble.	我是中文句子
But the problem now in Europe is the opposite: banks are “national in life, but European in death.”	我是中文句子
In Spain, for example, local savings banks (cajas) financed an outsize real-estate boom.	我是中文句子
The Spanish case is symptomatic of a larger problem.	我是中文句子
National supervisors always tend to minimize problems at home.	我是中文句子
But their resistance to recognizing problems at home runs even deeper.	我是中文句子
Until recently, the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country’s real-estate sector were temporary.	我是中文句子
To acknowledge the truth would have meant admitting that for years they had overlooked the build-up of an unsustainable construction boom that now threatens to bankrupt the entire country.	我是中文句子
In the case of Ireland, the situation was initially not much different.	我是中文句子
When problems started to surface, the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out “the cheapest bank rescue ever.”	我是中文句子
It thus seemed to make sense that even in the eurozone, banking supervision remained largely national.	我是中文句子
The recently created European Banking Authority has only limited powers over national supervisors, whose daily work is guided mainly by national considerations.	我是中文句子
But reality has shown that this approach is not tenable.	我是中文句子
Problems might originate at the national level, but, owing to monetary union, they quickly threaten the stability of the entire eurozone banking system.	我是中文句子
At their June summit, Europe’s leaders finally recognized the need to rectify this situation, transferring responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the European Central Bank.	我是中文句子
Given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union, putting the ECB in charge was an obvious choice.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the ECB already bears de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone’s banking system.	我是中文句子
Just ask any of the large international banking groups headquartered in financially stressed eurozone countries.	我是中文句子
Consider the case of a bank headquartered in Italy, but with an important subsidiary in Germany.	我是中文句子
The German operations naturally generate a surplus of funds (given that savings in Germany far exceed investment on average).	我是中文句子
The parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group’s liquidity.	我是中文句子
But the German supervisory authorities consider Italy at risk and thus oppose any transfer of funds there.	我是中文句子
The supervisor of the home country (Italy) has the opposite interest.	我是中文句子
It would like to see the “internal capital market” operate as much as possible.	我是中文句子
Here, too, it makes sense to have the ECB in charge as a neutral arbiter with respect to these opposing interests.	我是中文句子
Economic (and political) logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund.	我是中文句子
Officially, this has not yet been acknowledged.	我是中文句子
But that is often the way that European integration proceeds: an incomplete step in one area later requires further steps in related areas.	我是中文句子
This incremental approach has worked well in the past; indeed, today’s European Union resulted from it.	我是中文句子
But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time that they once had to explain to voters why one step required another.	我是中文句子
They will have to walk much more quickly to save the euro.	我是中文句子
The Renewed Promise of Abenomics	我是中文句子
The second arrow of Abenomics – monetary easing – intensified these effects.	我是中文句子
In the last two years, Japan’s stock market has almost doubled in value, increasing the wealth of Japanese consumers.	我是中文句子
Even more encouraging are developments in the labor market, which, unlike those in asset markets, reflect outcomes, not expectations.	我是中文句子
Here, too, the news is good.	我是中文句子
The labor market has tightened, with unemployment standing at 3.5% and the job-to-applicant ratio above parity.	我是中文句子
To be sure, there have been some setbacks: Japan’s GDP shrank in the second and third quarters of 2014.	我是中文句子
But the downturn, which resulted from April’s consumption-tax hike – from 5% to 8% – cannot be blamed on Abenomics.	我是中文句子
Indeed, Abe was honoring a law enacted by the previous government, led by the Democratic Party of Japan.	我是中文句子
The first two arrows of Abenomics were aimed at stimulating demand – and they were extremely effective.	我是中文句子
The good news is that the tax hike’s impact is temporary. Soon, it will begin to taper off, and industrial output will approach full capacity.	我是中文句子
Such reforms are essential to raise productivity growth and improve the Japanese economy’s competitiveness.	我是中文句子
Four imperatives stand out.	我是中文句子
The first task should be to eliminate – or, at least, reduce – the thicket of government regulations that is stifling economic dynamism.	我是中文句子
The current system is so convoluted and complex that it took more than three decades to open a new medical school in Tokyo.	我是中文句子
Likewise, flights to Haneda airport, a convenient connection to the Tokyo city area, have been rationed.	我是中文句子
This is no formula for long-term economic success.	我是中文句子
Japan’s leaders must also work to expand the workforce, which faces severe constraints, owing largely to the country’s rapidly aging population.	我是中文句子
Finally, Abe’s government must reduce the corporate-tax rate to align it more closely with international standards.	我是中文句子
Of course, this will require some sacrifices.	我是中文句子
Indeed, households have already endured some hardship, brought about by the consumption-tax hike.	我是中文句子
The next step is for Abe’s government to use its political capital to overcome vested interests, both in the bureaucracy and the business community.	我是中文句子
This means compelling businesses to give up some of the special tax benefits they now enjoy.	我是中文句子
For their part, politicians must participate in the taxpayer identification system.	我是中文句子
And bureaucrats must forego some of the power that excessive regulation affords them.	我是中文句子
For the sake of all Japanese – not to mention a world economy in need of a new source of dynamism – that promise deserves to be met.	我是中文句子
The Missing Arrow of Abenomics	我是中文句子
But the focus on public policy has left a “fourth arrow” – the private sector – untouched and seemingly ignored.	我是中文句子
This is unfortunate, because the government cannot fix Japan’s ills on its own.	我是中文句子
Labor productivity in the transport-equipment sector, for example, is barely half that of Germany.	我是中文句子
This trend puts annual GDP growth on course to average only 1.3% through 2025, implying a third consecutive decade of stagnation.	我是中文句子
Japan’s ability to alter its trajectory depends on individual companies making decisions to invest, change workplace policies, deploy new technologies, and test untried business models.	我是中文句子
Abe’s structural reforms will take time and political will to enact, but Japanese companies cannot afford to sit still.	我是中文句子
They can and must act, without waiting for the government to change its policies.	我是中文句子
In many cases, the economy’s bottlenecks are not regulatory in nature, but stem from entrenched ways of doing business.	我是中文句子
For starters, Japanese firms must become more globally integrated.	我是中文句子
Exporting to the fastest-growing overseas markets is one obvious route to overcoming sluggish demand growth at home.	我是中文句子
But, rather than just selling products abroad, Japanese enterprises need to expand operations beyond their borders and cast a wider net for international talent.	我是中文句子
Japanese companies have formidable R&D operations, but most will need to reconfigure them to obtain better returns and impact.	我是中文句子
The process must start with an understanding of what the customer wants and a determination to deliver solutions accordingly.	我是中文句子
Closed and tightly managed R&D operations must be transformed into more fluid, open processes involving collaboration with customers and suppliers.	我是中文句子
Japanese companies will also need to improve their capabilities in areas such as marketing, pricing, and talent development.	我是中文句子
While there are some pockets of excellence, most Japanese firms are severely lacking in these areas.	我是中文句子
To compete in global markets, they will need to achieve the same consistency in these areas that they have in their traditional areas of strength.	我是中文句子
Many Japanese companies have yet to digitize paper-based processes and replace outdated information-technology systems.	我是中文句子
Others would benefit from moving beyond basic digitization to next-generation technologies, such as big-data analytics.	我是中文句子
Companies can also head off looming labor shortages with intelligent software systems and robotics.	我是中文句子
Manufacturers can augment or replace their assembly lines with technologies such as the Internet of Things and 3D printing.	我是中文句子
More broadly, Japanese companies have to organize for performance and discipline.	我是中文句子
As policy changes unleash market forces, businesses will face greater competition.	我是中文句子
Some may need to reorganize or exit unprofitable markets; others may have to undertake mergers and acquisitions to achieve economies of scale.	我是中文句子
Finally, shareholders and senior executives should tie performance goals to incentives.	我是中文句子
Some of Japan’s corporate giants have already begun shifting from traditional seniority-based advancement toward merit-based pay structures.	我是中文句子
Others should follow their lead.	我是中文句子
Promoting younger and more diverse talent can create agile organizations with fresh ideas.	我是中文句子
If Japan’s private sector rises to the challenge, it can move the economy onto a path of faster growth.	我是中文句子
Innovations in one company would cascade across its entire industry by forcing competitors to raise their game.	我是中文句子
In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, Toyota introduced more efficient production processes that were eventually adopted by the entire automobile industry.	我是中文句子
Instead of settling for a future of 1.3% annual GDP growth, Japan could attain roughly 3% annual growth through 2025.	我是中文句子
Doing so would require the growth rate of labor productivity to more than double, but this is an attainable goal.	我是中文句子
More than half of this growth increment can be met by adopting best practices that companies around the world already use, while technology can close much of the remaining gap.	我是中文句子
Japanese business leaders need to combine big thinking with a focused attention to detail.	我是中文句子
Traditional ways of doing business may have to be abandoned.	我是中文句子
But there is ample scope to make progress and spur faster economic growth.	我是中文句子
Immense trade flows, the rise of billions of new consumers in the emerging world, and technology breakthroughs are rapidly transforming the global economy.	我是中文句子
Japan can shift its current trajectory by turning this wave of disruption into opportunity.	我是中文句子
From Russia With Unrequited Love	我是中文句子
NEW DELHI – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has assiduously courted Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him more than a dozen times in four years.	我是中文句子
This month he hosted Putin in Tokyo and in his hometown of Nagato (famed for its onsen, or natural hot springs).	我是中文句子
But Abe’s courtship has so far yielded little for Japan, and much for Russia.	我是中文句子
But Abe’s trust-building efforts with Russia are not aimed only at checking Chinese aggression.	我是中文句子
In exchange, Abe has offered economic aid, investments in Russia’s neglected Far East, and major energy deals.	我是中文句子
Abe has, however, encountered several obstacles.	我是中文句子
For starters, Japan is a participant in the US-led sanctions that were imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea in March 2014.	我是中文句子
In response to Abe’s overtures, Putin has doggedly tried to drive a hard bargain.	我是中文句子
“We think that we have no territorial problems,” he said. “It’s Japan that thinks that it has a territorial problem with Russia.”	我是中文句子
The US-led sanctions regime and low oil prices have battered the Russian economy, which is expected to contract by 0.8% in 2016.	我是中文句子
Thus, Putin is more reluctant than ever to offer territorial concessions, lest it tarnish his domestic image as a staunch defender of Russian national interests.	我是中文句子
Under the latter agreement, Japan and Russia are supposed create a “special framework” for joint economic activities on the disputed islands.	我是中文句子
But the plan has already run into trouble.	我是中文句子
If Japan did that, however, it would effectively be recognizing Russia’s jurisdiction over the islands.	我是中文句子
Abe has thus been denied the legacy that he sought, while Putin has succeeded in easing Russia’s international isolation.	我是中文句子
Abe was the first G7 leader to hold a summit with Putin after Russia annexed Crimea, and now Russia has won Japan’s economic cooperation, too.	我是中文句子
Japan is the only G7 country that has a territorial dispute with Russia, and it is clearly more eager to reach a deal than the Kremlin is.	我是中文句子
But this has only strengthened Russia’s hand.	我是中文句子
While Japan has softened its position, and signaled that it may accept only a partial return of the islands, Russia has grown only more intransigent.	我是中文句子
As it happens, this year marks the 60th anniversary of that joint declaration, which was widely viewed as a breakthrough at the time.	我是中文句子
The Kremlin is now suggesting that its commitment to fulfilling the declaration was conditional on Japan not joining any security alliance against Russia.	我是中文句子
And Putin has expressed concerns that the 1960 Japan-US Security Treaty would extend to the disputed islands if they were returned, thus allowing the US to establish a military presence there.	我是中文句子
Japan is in no position to address Russia’s concerns.	我是中文句子
Putin, for his part, appears smugly content with his negotiating position.	我是中文句子
There is little hope now that Abe will see tangible returns on the political capital he has invested in cultivating Putin.	我是中文句子
And Japan’s dilemma will only deepen.	我是中文句子
A Berlin Consensus?	我是中文句子
In particular, the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic.	我是中文句子
Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.	我是中文句子
By inductive reasoning, if we know the cause and effects, we can infer the principles.	我是中文句子
Eastern thinking, by contrast, has been abductive, moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps.	我是中文句子
Abductive inference is pragmatic, looking only at outcomes, guessing at the rule, and identifying the cause.	我是中文句子
Like history, social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time.	我是中文句子
European continental thinking, responding to urbanization and the need for social order, emphasized institutional analysis of political economy.	我是中文句子
But then technology, demographics, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee.	我是中文句子
A change of mindset is needed not just in the West, but also in the East.	我是中文句子
In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:	我是中文句子
The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers, and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them.	我是中文句子
Comprehensive destruction is often the order; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion.”	我是中文句子
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.	我是中文句子
Progress, on the contrary, requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order.”	我是中文句子
We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money.	我是中文句子
Sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the have-nots.	我是中文句子
The Washington Consensus of free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago.	我是中文句子
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity.	我是中文句子
Europe could use it.	我是中文句子
Accepting Japan at Its Word	我是中文句子
TOKYO – In recent years, the number of tourists visiting Japan has been increasing rapidly, reaching a record 13.4 million last year, a 29% increase from 2013.	我是中文句子
Chinese revolutionary leaders Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, along with many other prominent Asians, moved there as well.	我是中文句子
But, as Japan’s leaders have experienced firsthand since World War II, expressing regret to other countries is not so simple.	我是中文句子
Yet that is precisely what Prime Minister Shinzo Abe must do in his upcoming statement marking the 70th anniversary of the end of the war.	我是中文句子
Of course, Abe is far from the first Japanese leader to confront this challenge.	我是中文句子
His statement will follow a long line of declarations by prime ministers and chief cabinet secretaries expressing sincere remorse over the events of WWII.	我是中文句子
He went on to express “feelings of deep remorse” and offer a “heartfelt apology” to the victims.	我是中文句子
Koizumi also pledged that “Japan, as a peace-loving nation, will work to achieve peace and prosperity for all humankind with all its resources.”	我是中文句子
This intractability is, in some cases, understandable; the pain of survivors and their descendants remains acute.	我是中文句子
But in many other cases, the unwillingness to move beyond history is driven by political interests.	我是中文句子
Such depictions are breathtaking in their audacity, given Japan’s seven-decade record as a peaceful and constructive member of the international community.	我是中文句子
The prime minister, however, remains committed to issuing a strong and sincere statement on the subject.	我是中文句子
That is why they launched a whisper campaign against Abe’s statement months before he even began to write it.	我是中文句子
But, of course, Asian security and prosperity is in everyone’s interest.	我是中文句子
And it seems that Abe is, indeed, determined to make real contributions to peace, based on effective cooperation with Japan’s friends and allies.	我是中文句子
In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung responded positively to a statement by former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.	我是中文句子
The governments of Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries have done the same, and now welcome Japan’s commitment to act with its allies to protect regional security.	我是中文句子
It is time for the rest of the region to follow suit, accepting at face value Japan’s sincere apologies and working with the country to build a better future.	我是中文句子
At a time when Asia is facing serious security challenges, this stance could not be more urgent.	我是中文句子
A Big Chance for Small Farmers	我是中文句子
With serious management of the new funds, food production in Africa will soar.	我是中文句子
These are some of the poorest households in the world, and, ironically, some of the hungriest as well, despite being food producers.	我是中文句子
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity.	我是中文句子
As a result, their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence.	我是中文句子
Their poverty causes low farm productivity, and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty.	我是中文句子
It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.	我是中文句子
Now the key is to make this effort work.	我是中文句子
The lessons of history are clear.	我是中文句子
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices (or even free in some cases) will make a lasting difference.	我是中文句子
That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating.	我是中文句子
Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either out of their own cash, or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness.	我是中文句子
A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders, but obstacles remain.	我是中文句子
“Partnerships” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves, merely delaying real action.	我是中文句子
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars.	我是中文句子
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence.	我是中文句子
Assuming that a plan passes muster, the money to support it would quickly be disbursed.	我是中文句子
Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated.	我是中文句子
This approach is straightforward, efficient, accountable, and scientifically sound.	我是中文句子
Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade, and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance.	我是中文句子
Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach.	我是中文句子
All too often, the fight is about turf, rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor.	我是中文句子
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed: in the soil tilled by the world’s poorest farm families.	我是中文句子
A Black and White Question	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts.	我是中文句子
Alerted by a telephone call, a policeman arrived smartly on the scene.	我是中文句子
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out.	我是中文句子
The man refused.	我是中文句子
He was then told to identify himself.	我是中文句子
The man, still refusing to step out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID, and warned the cop not to mess with him.	我是中文句子
He said something about black men in America being singled out, and asked the cop, who was white, for his name and identification.	我是中文句子
The cop, joined by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct.	我是中文句子
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home, with the help of his chauffeur, because the door was jammed.	我是中文句子
What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness.	我是中文句子
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast.	我是中文句子
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done.	我是中文句子
That, too, would not have been unusual.	我是中文句子
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama.	我是中文句子
That is why he warned the cop, Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police force, not to mess with him.	我是中文句子
Class and race overlap in the US.	我是中文句子
In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart.	我是中文句子
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity.	我是中文句子
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”	我是中文句子
Alas, Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates.	我是中文句子
Both he and Gates then spoke of “learning” from the incident.	我是中文句子
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.	我是中文句子
The complexities of black anger, white guilt, and of black, and white fear, are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all.	我是中文句子
The field is too full of mines.	我是中文句子
One of Obama’s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.	我是中文句子
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?	我是中文句子
One might argue that it was.	我是中文句子
If not Professor Gates, then who?	我是中文句子
Precisely because he is a grandee, he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue.	我是中文句子
The fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice.	我是中文句子
There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race.	我是中文句子
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.	我是中文句子
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance.	我是中文句子
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates’ skin. There was no question of violence.	我是中文句子
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop.	我是中文句子
A Bollywood Bride for Sarkozy?	我是中文句子
His ratings have dipped below 50% for the first time.	我是中文句子
Older French citizens don’t find the public spectacle of their leader in love very amusing.	我是中文句子
Abroad, Egyptian lawmakers were so exercised over the prospect of the French head of state sharing a bed with his girlfriend that several vented their disapproval on the floor of the parliament.	我是中文句子
Likewise, India is all in a quandary over how to handle protocol during Sarkozy’s impending visit to the subcontinent as the guest of honor at the country’s Republic Day celebrations on January 26.	我是中文句子
Should the First Girlfriend have her own motorcade, as a first lady would?	我是中文句子
This controversy has threatened to cast a pall over a much-heralded summit between two of the world’s great democracies.	我是中文句子
The couple exchanged significant tokens of their mutual affection: he offered her a heart-shaped pink diamond ring by Dior, she offered him a Swiss watch.	我是中文句子
It’s “serious,” the smitten president admitted.	我是中文句子
But he refused, even under direct questioning by reporters, to reveal an exact date.	我是中文句子
“You’ll probably find out after it’s happened,” he taunted.	我是中文句子
If that is true, then Sarkozy missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime.	我是中文句子
And, given the current rage for all things Bollywood in France, a lavish Indian wedding would be fitting.	我是中文句子
Bruni’s own life path closely resembles any number of Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress.	我是中文句子
A comely brunette who sings is perfect for a Bollywood makeover.	我是中文句子
The Indian government will be nothing if not relieved to see the first girlfriend made a wife.	我是中文句子
As one of India’s leading daily newspapers, the Indian Express, spelled it out, lest anyone be confused, “a girlfriend is not a wife or spouse.”	我是中文句子
Once wed, all protocol worries about the French delegation would simply disappear.	我是中文句子
Despite the sometimes downright pornographic on-screen writhing of Bollywood starlets, India is still a deeply conservative society.	我是中文句子
Divorce is anathema. (Sarkozy is now twice divorced.)	我是中文句子
And, while mistresses abound among the privileged classes, they do not strut publicly by their power-mates’ sides.	我是中文句子
Kissing and fondling in public, even by spouses, is taboo.	我是中文句子
In this respect, India more resembles the France with which Sarkozy wants to make a clean break than the current one.	我是中文句子
Sarkozy, of all people, should know that a large part of the gravitas of office derives from pomp and circumstance.	我是中文句子
Statecraft is a realm where appearances are meant to be deceiving.	我是中文句子
Most French people could only dream of an exotic wedding in India.	我是中文句子
Sarkozy could make that dream come true.	我是中文句子
He could meet his bride seated majestically on the caparison of an elaborately decorated elephant, and she would look ravishing swathed and bejeweled in Indian finery.	我是中文句子
The “bling-bling” president, as Sarkozy has been dubbed, can wear all the gold he wants and heap yet more diamonds on his bride.	我是中文句子
The cameras would roll, Indians would smile, and France would be treated to a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams.	我是中文句子
And if it’s too late for the wedding, there’s always the reception.	我是中文句子
A Born-Again CAP	我是中文句子
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union’s future needs. The CAP must be born again.	我是中文句子
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed, and food security was achieved.	我是中文句子
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project.	我是中文句子
Pollution would be reduced by 70% as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water, and greenhouse gases would be cut.	我是中文句子
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries, so with today’s 27 members the possibilities are even greater.	我是中文句子
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially.	我是中文句子
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered.	我是中文句子
The status quo clearly has to be changed.	我是中文句子
Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community. But that attitude is undermining change.	我是中文句子
Competition must be encouraged, as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community, with fewer farmers but better farms.	我是中文句子
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner, more productive, and efficient agriculture.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the CAP’s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place.	我是中文句子
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces, as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society.	我是中文句子
If the market “misbehaves,” farmers could be reduced to poverty, leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe.	我是中文句子
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.	我是中文句子
1.      The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture’s competitiveness.	我是中文句子
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands, substantially contributing to the development and power of the country’s agribusiness.	我是中文句子
2.      Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use.	我是中文句子
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level, but agricultural production and land use are not among them.	我是中文句子
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure.	我是中文句子
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy.	我是中文句子
3.      A policy for European food systems would treat production, processing, distribution, logistics, and retailing in combination.	我是中文句子
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.	我是中文句子
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation’s “Forward Look on European Food Systems” could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy.	我是中文句子
4.      Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land.	我是中文句子
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects.	我是中文句子
5.      A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe’s landscapes.	我是中文句子
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere, nor should it ignore cost.	我是中文句子
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land.	我是中文句子
These five pillars involve drastic choices, but they will probably require less money from Europe’s taxpayers, not more.	我是中文句子
They could make a real contribution to cleaner, more productive, and efficient farming and land use, while addressing social needs.	我是中文句子
A Breakthrough Against Hunger	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Today’s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.	我是中文句子
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.	我是中文句子
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.	我是中文句子
Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers.	我是中文句子
The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.	我是中文句子
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.	我是中文句子
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can’t afford it.	我是中文句子
With donor help, they can.	我是中文句子
Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future.	我是中文句子
By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own.	我是中文句子
Helping the poor with today’s technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor.	我是中文句子
These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.	我是中文句子
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we’ll need more of them.	我是中文句子
Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger.	我是中文句子
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so.	我是中文句子
The current aid structures are inadequate.	我是中文句子
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.	我是中文句子
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate.	我是中文句子
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.	我是中文句子
African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds.	我是中文句子
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need.	我是中文句子
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors.	我是中文句子
The time for business as usual is over.	我是中文句子
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track.	我是中文句子
Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.	我是中文句子
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public’s hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success.	我是中文句子
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.	我是中文句子
A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Every year, millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases, especially in poor countries.	我是中文句子
In many cases, lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced, but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them.	我是中文句子
This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected.	我是中文句子
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today.	我是中文句子
One is that they are very costly; or, more accurately, the price charged for them is very high, though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount.	我是中文句子
Because the poor have so little money to spend, drug companies, under current arrangements, have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them.	我是中文句子
It doesn’t have to be this way.	我是中文句子
Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development.	我是中文句子
Even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market; most individuals’ purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance.	我是中文句子
Government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good.	我是中文句子
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness.	我是中文句子
Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available.	我是中文句子
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles: when one is used to light another, it does not diminish the light of the first.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, everything becomes brighter.	我是中文句子
Yet, in America and most of the world, drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited.	我是中文句子
In the health-care sector, it may be more profitable to devote research to a “me-too” drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference.	我是中文句子
A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund.	我是中文句子
With a prize system, innovators are rewarded for new knowledge, but they do not retain a monopoly on its use.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach.	我是中文句子
His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research, which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing.	我是中文句子
But, globally, our innovation system needs much bigger changes.	我是中文句子
The WHO’s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial.	我是中文句子
In late May, the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly – a moment of hope for public health around the world.	我是中文句子
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics.	我是中文句子
It is, in many cases, a matter of life and death.	我是中文句子
It is therefore essential to de-link R&D incentives from drug prices, and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge.	我是中文句子
For America, the Sanders bill marks important progress.	我是中文句子
We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by.	我是中文句子
India’s Change of Guard	我是中文句子
SINGAPORE – In August, Raghuram Rajan was appointed Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.	我是中文句子
On one level, this was a routine announcement that many had anticipated – after all, Rajan is arguably the best-known Indian economist of his generation.	我是中文句子
On another level, however, his appointment can be seen as part of a broader generational shift.	我是中文句子
Rajan, just 50, will be the first RBI governor born after India became a republic in 1950.	我是中文句子
Similar changes are taking place in all walks of Indian life, including politics, the arts, sports, and social development.	我是中文句子
And India will be better for it.	我是中文句子
But now younger entrants are rising everywhere, bringing with them energy and new ideas.	我是中文句子
Either man would be the first prime minister who was not born in the British Raj.	我是中文句子
The arts were one of the first areas to witness this generational change.	我是中文句子
Rather than write for literary critics, they began to use a simpler language, including Indian turns of phrase.	我是中文句子
Predictably, the purists pounced and the critics ridiculed.	我是中文句子
But people have bought their books in the millions, and film deals have followed.	我是中文句子
As a result, the market for books has dramatically expanded and publishers have been forced to change their entire business strategies.	我是中文句子
Thanks partly to this parade of new talent, the Indian music industry is experiencing a period of extraordinary innovation and expansion.	我是中文句子
The output of the US and European music industries sounds stale in comparison, owing to a dearth of innovation over the last two decades.	我是中文句子
Generational change has even come to India’s most popular sport – cricket.	我是中文句子
India’s social sector has also been transformed.	我是中文句子
Development policy used to be dominated by career activists wedded to socialist-era thinking.	我是中文句子
Ironically, it is the world of business that remains slow to change.	我是中文句子
The growth of the IT sector in the 1990’s seemed to promise that change would be rapid and far-reaching, but the old business families still dominate.	我是中文句子
There is hope, though.	我是中文句子
Yes, India’s economy has slowed sharply, the rupee has plunged, and scandals and protests dominate the headlines.	我是中文句子
But, behind the gloom, a new generation is taking over, bringing with it fresh ideas and visions for India.	我是中文句子
Absent-Minded Killers	我是中文句子
As a species, human beings have a major self-control problem.	我是中文句子
Our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life.	我是中文句子
The Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit, established that “biological diversity is a common concern of humanity.”	我是中文句子
In 2002, the treaty’s signatories went further, committing to “a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss” by 2010.	我是中文句子
That neglect is a human tragedy.	我是中文句子
We kill other species not because we must, but because we are too negligent to do otherwise.	我是中文句子
Consider a couple of notorious examples.	我是中文句子
Some rich countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand, have fishing fleets that engage in so-called “bottom trawling.”	我是中文句子
Bottom trawlers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom, destroying magnificent, unexplored, and endangered marine species in the process.	我是中文句子
One of these species, orange roughy, has been caught commercially for only around a quarter-century, but already is being fished to the point of collapse.	我是中文句子
Likewise, in many parts of the world, tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops.	我是中文句子
The result is massive loss of habitat and destruction of species, yielding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost.	我是中文句子
After cutting down a swath of rainforest, soils are often quickly leached of their nutrients so that they cannot sustain crops or nutritious grasses for livestock.	我是中文句子
As a result, the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned, with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems.	我是中文句子
Because these activities’ costs are so high and their benefits so low, stopping them would be easy.	我是中文句子
Bottom trawling should simply be outlawed; it would be simple and inexpensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities.	我是中文句子
Forest clearing, on the other hand, is probably best stopped by economic incentives, perhaps combined with regulatory limits.	我是中文句子
Simply restricting the practice of land clearing probably would not work, since farm families and communities would face a strong temptation to evade legal limits.	我是中文句子
At the same time, small farmers would receive a steady flow of income, which they could use for micro-investments to improve their household’s wealth, education, and health.	我是中文句子
Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species, but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas.	我是中文句子
We also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abundance and extinction, just as we now have such a process for climate change.	我是中文句子
Politicians don’t listen very well to individual scientists, but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice.	我是中文句子
Finally, the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow human-induced climate change.	我是中文句子
There can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species’ viability.	我是中文句子
As the planet warms, and rain and storm patterns change dramatically, many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival.	我是中文句子
These measures are achievable by 2010.	我是中文句子
They are affordable, and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits.	我是中文句子
Most importantly, they would allow us to follow through on a global promise.	我是中文句子
It is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species – and jeopardize our own future – in a fit of absent-mindedness.	我是中文句子
Making Do With More	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – In the United States, just three out of ten workers are needed to produce and deliver the goods we consume.	我是中文句子
And yet, despite our obvious ability to produce much more than we need, we do not seem to be blessed with an embarrassment of riches.	我是中文句子
One of the great paradoxes of our time is that workers and middle-class households continue to struggle in a time of unparalleled plenty.	我是中文句子
We in the developed countries have more than enough to cover our basic needs.	我是中文句子
And we produce all of it for an average of less than two hours a day of work outside the home.	我是中文句子
It will take another generation, perhaps, before robots have completely taken over manufacturing, kitchen work, and construction; and the developing world looks to be 50 years behind. But Keynes would have been spot on had he targeted his essay at his readers' great-great-great-great grandchildren.	我是中文句子
And yet there are few signs that working- and middle-class Americans are living any better than they did 35 years ago.	我是中文句子
Growth prospects are even worse, as innovation hits gale-force headwinds.	我是中文句子
For most of human experience, the bulk of what we produced could not be easily shared or used without permission.	我是中文句子
The goods we made were what economists call “rival" and “excludible" commodities.	我是中文句子
Being “rival" means that two people cannot use the same product at the same time.	我是中文句子
Being “excludible" means that the owner of a product can easily prevent others from using it.	我是中文句子
These two traits put a great deal of bargaining power in the hands of those who control production and distribution, making them ideal for a market economy based on private property.	我是中文句子
Money naturally flows to where utility and value are being provided – and those flows are easy to track in national accounts.	我是中文句子
But much of what we are producing in the information age is neither rival nor excludible – and this changes the entire picture.	我是中文句子
The creation of information-age goods is difficult to incentivize; their distribution is hard to monetize; and we lack the tools to track them easily in national accounts.	我是中文句子
The result is an ever-growing discrepancy between what people would be willing to pay for a given service and growth as measured in national statistics.	我是中文句子
This produces a set of unique problems.	我是中文句子
In addition to developing ways to account for this new type of wealth, we will have to develop channels through which demand for a product contributes to the income of its creator.	我是中文句子
Making Academia Matter Again	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – Academic freedom is a precious commodity, critical to ensure that discovery of the truth is not encumbered by political or ideological forces.	我是中文句子
We experts should have to explain ourselves.	我是中文句子
Scholarly books and journals often give the impression that the truth is revealed through a neat, orderly, and logical process.	我是中文句子
But research is far from being a pristine landscape; in fact, it resembles a battlefield, littered with miscalculations, failed experiments, and discarded assumptions.	我是中文句子
The path to truth is often convoluted, and those who travel along it often must navigate fierce competition and professional intrigue.	我是中文句子
Some argue that it is better to hide this reality from the public, in order to maintain credibility.	我是中文句子
For example, in 2014, physicists collaborating on a project known as BICEP2 thought that they had detected gravitational waves from the beginning of the universe.	我是中文句子
It was later realized that the signal they had detected could be entirely attributed to interstellar dust.	我是中文句子
Some of my colleagues worried that this revelation would undermine faith in other scientific predictions, such as those involving climate change.	我是中文句子
But would hiding the truth from the public really do more for scientific and academic credibility than cultivating a culture of transparency?	我是中文句子
Probably not.	我是中文句子
Students should be encouraged to take courses in multiple disciplines, so that they can weave those lessons and experiences into new patterns of knowledge.	我是中文句子
To make this process sustainable, universities should ensure that the courses and curricula they offer help students to develop the skills that a fast-changing labor market demands.	我是中文句子
Of course, the latter approach can be useful if the goal is to advance the popularity of one’s own research program and to ensure that one’s own ideas and perspective endure.	我是中文句子
But that is not the fundamental mission of academia.	我是中文句子
The louder the consensus in the echo chambers of academia become, the greater the ego boost for those who inhabit those chambers.	我是中文句子
But history shows that progress is sometimes advocated by a soft voice in the background, like that of Albert Einstein during his early career.	我是中文句子
Truth and consensus are not always the same.	我是中文句子
Diversity of opinion – which implies diversity of gender, ethnicity, and background – is vital to support creativity, discovery, and progress.	我是中文句子
That is why it is so important for prizes and professional associations to be used not to reinforce mainstream perspectives, but rather to encourage independent thought and reward innovation.	我是中文句子
This does not mean that all opinions should be considered equal, but rather that alternative views should be debated and vetted on merit alone.	我是中文句子
We in academia cannot continue to pat ourselves on the back, celebrating our own privileges and failing to look at the world in new and relevant ways.	我是中文句子
The Closing of the Academic Mind	我是中文句子
LONDON – I would wager that I have been Chancellor of more universities than anyone alive today.	我是中文句子
This is partly because when I was Governor of Hong Kong, I was made Chancellor of every university in the city.	我是中文句子
I protested that it would surely be better for the universities to choose their own constitutional heads.	我是中文句子
But the universities would not allow me to resign gracefully.	我是中文句子
When I came back to Britain in 1997, I was asked to become Chancellor of Newcastle University.	我是中文句子
Then, in 2003, I was elected Chancellor by the graduates of Oxford University, one of the world’s greatest institutions of learning.	我是中文句子
So it should not be surprising that I have strong views about what it means to be a university and to teach, do research, or study at one.	我是中文句子
Universities should be bastions of freedom in any society.	我是中文句子
They should be free from government interference in their primary purposes of research and teaching; and they should control their own academic governance.	我是中文句子
I do not believe it is possible for a university to become or remain a world-class institution if these conditions do not exist.	我是中文句子
The role of a university is to promote the clash of ideas, to test the results of research with other scholars, and to impart new knowledge to students.	我是中文句子
That, of course, makes universities dangerous to authoritarian governments, which seek to stifle the ability to raise and attempt to answer difficult questions.	我是中文句子
In the United States and the United Kingdom, some students and teachers now seek to constrain argument and debate.	我是中文句子
They contend that people should not be exposed to ideas with which they strongly disagree.	我是中文句子
Moreover, they argue that history should be rewritten to expunge the names (though not the endowments) of those who fail to pass today’s tests of political correctness.	我是中文句子
Thomas Jefferson and Cecil Rhodes, among others, have been targeted.	我是中文句子
And how would Churchill and Washington fare if the same tests were applied to them?	我是中文句子
There are calls for “safe spaces” where students can be protected from anything that assaults their sense of what is moral and appropriate.	我是中文句子
This reflects and inevitably nurtures a harmful politics of victimization – defining one’s own identity (and thus one’s interests) in opposition to others.	我是中文句子
When I was a student 50 years ago, my principal teacher was a leading Marxist historian and former member of the Communist Party.	我是中文句子
The British security services were deeply suspicious of him.	我是中文句子
He was a great historian and teacher, but these days I might be encouraged to think that he had threatened my “safe space.”	我是中文句子
Of course, some ideas – incitement of racial hatred, gender hostility, or political violence – are anathema in every free society.	我是中文句子
Liberty requires some limits (decided freely by democratic argument under the rule of law) in order to exist.	我是中文句子
Universities should be trusted to exercise that degree of control themselves.	我是中文句子
But intolerance of debate, of discussion, and of particular branches of scholarship should never be tolerated.	我是中文句子
As the great political philosopher Karl Popper taught us, the only thing we should be intolerant of is intolerance itself.	我是中文句子
That is especially true at universities.	我是中文句子
Yet some American and British academics and students are themselves undermining freedom; paradoxically, they have the liberty to do so.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, universities in China and Hong Kong are faced with threats to their autonomy and freedom, not from within, but from an authoritarian government.	我是中文句子
In Hong Kong, the autonomy of universities and free speech itself, guaranteed in the city’s Basic Law and the 50-year treaty between Britain and China on the city’s status, are under threat.	我是中文句子
The rationale seems to be that, because students strongly supported the pro-democracy protests in 2014, the universities where they study should be brought to heel.	我是中文句子
So the city’s government blunders away, stirring up trouble, clearly on the orders of the government in Beijing.	我是中文句子
The five were publishing books that exposed some of the dirty secrets of China’s leaders.	我是中文句子
On the mainland, the Chinese Communist Party has launched the biggest crackdown on universities since the aftermath of the killings in Tiananmen Square in 1989.	我是中文句子
There is to be no discussion of so-called Western values in China’s universities. Only Marxism can be taught.	我是中文句子
Did no one tell President Xi Jinping and his Politburo colleagues where Karl Marx came from?	我是中文句子
The trouble these days is precisely that they know little about Marx but a lot about Lenin.	我是中文句子
Westerners should take a closer interest in what is happening in China’s universities and what that tells us about the real values underpinning scholarship, teaching, and the academy.	我是中文句子
Compare and contrast, as students are asked to do.	我是中文句子
Do you want universities where the government decides what it is allegedly safe for you to learn and discuss?	我是中文句子
The New Brain Drain in Science	我是中文句子
Having published fewer than ten papers since his groundbreaking work in 1964, Higgs believes that no university would employ him nowadays.	我是中文句子
Academics are well acquainted with the notion of “publish or perish.”	我是中文句子
Whether the work they are publishing has a measurable impact on their field of study is, sadly, too often a secondary concern.	我是中文句子
The incentives they face mean that quantity often comes before quality.	我是中文句子
Academic journals determine the various disciplinary rankings that academic institutions are compelled to climb, which leads institutions to hire and retain only those scholars who can produce at high rates.	我是中文句子
This has given rise to a deeper, twofold problem: academic journals have become disproportionately influential, and they have placed a premium on empirical research.	我是中文句子
With respect to the first problem, journals are gradually replacing institutions as the arbiters of quality within academic communities.	我是中文句子
Scholars in almost any discipline seeking jobs at “A-level” institutions must publish in a select few A-level journals that are seen as gateways.	我是中文句子
These journals’ editorial boards increasingly privilege positivist theoretical work – meaning research that is based on empirical data analysis.	我是中文句子
Qualitative research – such as ethnographies, participatory surveys, and case studies – is often designated as suitable only for B- and C-level journals.	我是中文句子
This kind of work can be cheaper, too, because a single data set can generate multiple journal articles.	我是中文句子
To be sure, there is nothing wrong with scientific practices evolving along with technology, or with academics using richer data sets and better software.	我是中文句子
But adoption of this quantitative approach should not be the single most important criterion for assessing scientific excellence and deciding career trajectories.	我是中文句子
After all, knowledge is acquired in different ways, and empirical positivism is only one method in a larger epistemological inventory.	我是中文句子
The positivist trend in science today is particularly problematic for developing countries, where data sets are scarce and often of poor quality.	我是中文句子
Academics who move from data-rich countries in Europe and North America to data-poor countries in the Middle East and elsewhere often face this problem.	我是中文句子
Non-English academic journals simply do not command the same attention in the science community.	我是中文句子
As a result, the scope of research topics that many countries can undertake is limited, and they must struggle to retain scientific talent.	我是中文句子
This is particularly true in the Middle East, where governments are struggling to diversify their economies, in order to make them more resilient.	我是中文句子
Closing the Financial Services’ Accessibility Gap	我是中文句子
KAMPALA – Last month, the United Kingdom hosted the first-ever Global Disability Summit to help focus the world’s attention on the needs of people with disabilities.	我是中文句子
The agenda was packed with topics like building equitable education, ending discrimination, and bringing technology to disabled communities – especially poor countries in the Global South.	我是中文句子
But one challenge that did not receive the attention it deserved is an often-overlooked component of development policy: access to financial services.	我是中文句子
This was a missed opportunity – not only for the world’s one billion disabled people, but also for the institutions that should be serving them.	我是中文句子
Increasing the accessibility of financial services is good for business and economic growth.	我是中文句子
Moreover, with more than $1 trillion in disposable income, the so-called disability market is among the biggest potential client bases in the world. In other words, financial-service providers have every reason to cater to people with disabilities.	我是中文句子
Why, then, are most businesses doing just the opposite?	我是中文句子
One reason is a lack of awareness.	我是中文句子
Because people with disabilities typically have less income than their nondisabled peers, service providers have often lacked an incentive to extend support to them.	我是中文句子
But, with more attention being paid to total market potential, financial institutions are starting to adjust their product lines accordingly.	我是中文句子
As they do, four issues must be addressed to maximize the benefits for customers with accessibility challenges.	我是中文句子
First, financial-services companies must work harder to understand the needs of current and future clients.	我是中文句子
For example, with better data, a bank in a particular market could improve the accessibility of its mobile-banking platforms.	我是中文句子
This is essentially what happened at Standard Chartered Bank in India last year, when employees developed a voice-assisted system to help visually impaired customers access their accounts online.	我是中文句子
Good data are also essential to the effectiveness of advocacy groups as they push providers to improve their services.	我是中文句子
Second, engagement must not stop with innovative products; it must also be extended to the labor market.	我是中文句子
Simply put, the financial-services industry should hire more people with disabilities by investing in assistive technologies like braille readers and alternative and augmentative communication devices.	我是中文句子
The need to diversify the workforce is particularly acute in the United States, where one in five people has a disability.	我是中文句子
Third, people with disabilities must always be included in discussions about how to expand and strengthen financial independence.	我是中文句子
This innovative document codified how banks should tailor products to clients with cognitive impairments.	我是中文句子
Future initiatives should follow this collaborative model to ensure that decision-making at all levels is facilitated by human-centered design.	我是中文句子
And, lastly, governments must commit to addressing this issue, by emulating the action of countries like the UK, which has linked services for the disabled to development funding.	我是中文句子
Our vision is to encourage the emergence of similar programs in many other countries around the world.	我是中文句子
With 91 countries having already ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is clear that there is plenty of political support for these initiatives.	我是中文句子
The challenge now is to turn pledges into action.	我是中文句子
In the coming decades, the world’s disabled population will grow as medical advances allow people to live longer, healthier, fuller lives.	我是中文句子
Providing the disabled with access to financial services and products is among the best ways to guard against discrimination and nurture long-term empowerment.	我是中文句子
Full financial inclusion will come slowly for a community often referred to as the “fastest-growing minority group in the world.”	我是中文句子
The task for activists, advocates, enlightened business leaders, and policymakers is to highlight the social and economic benefits of success.	我是中文句子
Surgery for All	我是中文句子
BOSTON – On a recent trip to India, I hailed a rickshaw that was pedaled, I soon noticed, by a man with a lame leg.	我是中文句子
It turns out that a few weeks earlier, the driver had been hit by a car while navigating the busy streets of New Delhi.	我是中文句子
This type of tragic calculus is strikingly common.	我是中文句子
One of the biggest obstacles to achieving universal health coverage – which the United Nations has declared a global goal – is financing.	我是中文句子
And, paradoxical as it may sound, one of the best ways that governments can get the money they need to expand coverage is by making surgery more widely available.	我是中文句子
But untreated or undertreated conditions requiring surgery also hurt economic productivity.	我是中文句子
Failure to maintain strong surgical capacity could even undercut economic gains made by middle-income countries, reducing total GDP growth by approximately 2% annually.	我是中文句子
For many leaders, the common perception is that provision of surgical care is not sustainable or cost-effective.	我是中文句子
But a growing body of evidence suggests that these views are misplaced.	我是中文句子
But reforms that focus more attention on the importance of surgery would boost economic productivity and help create more equitable health care for everyone.	我是中文句子
For starters, health ministries and physician organizations should formally recognize that surgical and anesthetic care are an essential part of universal health coverage.	我是中文句子
Second, to pool risk and guard against cost overruns, countries that are considering universal coverage policies should put surgical care under publicly financed plans.	我是中文句子
Finally, to streamline resources and increase surgical capacity, hospitals should explore task-sharing, whereby non-emergency cases are referred to licensed nurses and physician assistants.	我是中文句子
Longer-term strategies include investing more in medical education to bolster the ranks of doctors and surgeons.	我是中文句子
The tremendous economic progress that many developing countries have made in recent decades has been largely driven by vibrant, young, and ambitious populations.	我是中文句子
One of the most effective ways to maintain this growth and development is to ensure access to safe and affordable healthcare – including surgery.	我是中文句子
While the cost of providing it may be high, the cost of not providing it is even higher.	我是中文句子
Polluters Must Pay	我是中文句子
BP has already committed more than $20 billion in remediation and penalties.	我是中文句子
Based on a settlement last week, BP will now pay the largest criminal penalty in US history – $4.5 billion.	我是中文句子
As we enter a new era of sustainable development, impunity must turn to responsibility.	我是中文句子
Polluters must pay, whether in rich or poor countries.	我是中文句子
Major companies need to accept responsibility for their actions.	我是中文句子
Nigeria has been Exhibit A of corporate environmental impunity.	我是中文句子
Yet it also noted that the region’s biodiversity was under massive threat, with little or no protection.	我是中文句子
The environmental destruction of the delta is part of a larger saga: corrupt companies operating hand in hand with corrupt government officials.	我是中文句子
The companies routinely bribe officials to gain oil leases, lie about output, evade taxes, and dodge responsibility for the environmental damage that they cause.	我是中文句子
Nigerian officials have become fabulously wealthy, owing to decades of payoffs by international companies that have plundered the delta’s natural wealth.	我是中文句子
In the colonial era, it was the official purpose of imperial power to extract wealth from the administered territories.	我是中文句子
In the post-colonial period, the methods are better disguised.	我是中文句子
When oil companies misbehave in Nigeria or elsewhere, they are protected by the power of their home countries.	我是中文句子
Don’t mess with the companies, they are told by the United States and Europe.	我是中文句子
(Dick Cheney went from being Halliburton’s CEO to the US vice presidency.)	我是中文句子
The report was as scathing as it was scientifically clear.	我是中文句子
The SDGs offer a critical opportunity for the world to set clear, compelling standards for government and corporate behavior.	我是中文句子
Many major companies, including in the oil industry, have expressed their readiness to support sustainable development goals.	我是中文句子
Cleaning up the Niger Delta would provide the strongest possible example of a new age of accountability.	我是中文句子
The Nigerian government’s own accountability is on the line as well.	我是中文句子
It is heartening that several Nigerian senators have recently been in the forefront of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector.	我是中文句子
Saving Capitalism from Economics 101	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – All across the United States, students are settling into college – and coming to grips with “Econ 101.”	我是中文句子
Markets can be good, but they are also profoundly susceptible to abusive practices, including by prominent private-sector people.	我是中文句子
This is not a theoretical concern; it is central to our current policy debates, including important new US legislation that has just been put forward.	我是中文句子
One core problem is that market incentives reward self-interested private behavior, without accounting for social benefits or costs.	我是中文句子
We generally overlook our actions’ spillover effects on others, or “externalities.”	我是中文句子
The New York Times counts 76 rollbacks in progress.	我是中文句子
The thinking behind this policy is straight out of the first few weeks of Econ 101: get out of the way of the market.	我是中文句子
As a result, there is a lot more pollution – including more emission of greenhouse gases – in America’s future.	我是中文句子
There is also an even deeper problem.	我是中文句子
There is a general presumption in Econ 101 that firms should maximize profits, and that this is best for their shareholders and for society.	我是中文句子
To understand the nature and impact of these decisions, we need to look closely at the incentives of firms’ senior managers and board members.	我是中文句子
Since the 1970s, the people who run firms have become much more focused on increasing their compensation, through bonuses, stock options, and the like.	我是中文句子
There has been a significant rise in the value of shares, most of which are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans.	我是中文句子
Today, it is top managers and members of boards of directors in whose interest firms are run.	我是中文句子
To make this more meaningful and generally improve transparency, ordinary (non-management) employees should get some representation on the board of directors.	我是中文句子
This type of arrangement works well in Germany, a country where workers continue to be treated with respect.	我是中文句子
Originally, the purpose was to enable the private sector to carry out large-scale risky investments that had broader potential impact, such as building canals and railroads.	我是中文句子
Realistically, the enforcement of antitrust law has slipped a long way in recent years, under both Republican and Democratic administrations.	我是中文句子
Warren is proposing a much broader rethink.	我是中文句子
Large corporations can still do well, but they need to be held accountable in a much more transparent way.	我是中文句子
Incentives for executives would be adjusted, and running these companies would no longer be so much about lining their own pockets.	我是中文句子
Workers would no longer be treated so badly, and more people might even start to believe again in the American Dream of prosperity for all.	我是中文句子
So, yes, like it or not, this will be on the final exam.	我是中文句子
A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold	我是中文句子
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency.	我是中文句子
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that, at least for large countries, currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders.	我是中文句子
At a minimum, currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone.	我是中文句子
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises, but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever.	我是中文句子
Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the eurozone’s crisis countries, but not necessarily for its stronger northern region.	我是中文句子
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau.	我是中文句子
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada, Australia, and the United States.	我是中文句子
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania, which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain.	我是中文句子
For a normal country, the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions.	我是中文句子
Europe, of course, has no significant centralized tax authority, so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent.	我是中文句子
This claim was hugely misguided.	我是中文句子
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness.	我是中文句子
But, in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels, the short term can stretch out for a very long time.	我是中文句子
Indeed, more than 20 years on, Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification.	我是中文句子
Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will be rampant.	我是中文句子
Europe’s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework.	我是中文句子
European policymakers today often complain that, were it not for the US financial crisis, the eurozone would be doing just fine.	我是中文句子
Perhaps they are right.	我是中文句子
But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks, including big ones.	我是中文句子
Europe may never be an “optimum” currency area by any standard.	我是中文句子
Achieving a “Europe of Results”	我是中文句子
BRUSSELS – The tsunami that has swept across financial markets is a global catastrophe.	我是中文句子
If handled correctly, however, the crisis may yet raise the esteem of the European Union and its institutions.	我是中文句子
The voter-turnout problem partly reflects frustration about the present state of the EU, and also people’s impression that they can exert little influence by voting one way or the other.	我是中文句子
But in most cases, this is not possible.	我是中文句子
At first sight, the easiest answer to the problem of low voter turnout is to give more power to the European Parliament.	我是中文句子
And this year’s elections saw a more intensive presence of party organizations at European level than ever before.	我是中文句子
The Euro-skepticism problem can be tackled only if the Union itself starts to perform better, and is seen to be doing so.	我是中文句子
Given the gravity of the economic crisis, the time has come for the EU to demonstrate its strengths whenever possible.	我是中文句子
Europe’s citizens understand that the relatively small nation-states that make up the EU are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own.	我是中文句子
A changing world in which new powers like China and India play an increasingly important role will not wait for Europe to make up its mind.	我是中文句子
The EU must instead show leadership through its efforts to solve the world’s current problems.	我是中文句子
As for the European People’s Party, for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people.	我是中文句子
That doesn’t mean that we are advocating a move to socialism; we want better and smarter regulation, not regulation for its own sake.	我是中文句子
We see five keys to recovery:	我是中文句子
A “Europe of Results” is achievable.	我是中文句子
The Education Roadmap to 2030	我是中文句子
For Syrian youths who have been forced from their homes and have lost everything, education is about more than qualifications or test scores; it embodies their hope for the future.	我是中文句子
This goal is still a distant prospect for far too many children.	我是中文句子
As the old African proverb goes, if you educate a girl, you educate an entire nation.	我是中文句子
Ensuring access to quality education for children, especially girls, will lead to fewer child marriages and less child labor and exploitation.	我是中文句子
Tackling the education challenge needs to start from two principles embedded in the goal.	我是中文句子
First, “for all” means that we must focus on the children who have been left behind.	我是中文句子
Millions of children are out of school or are receiving a substandard education because of who they are or where they live.	我是中文句子
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, refugee children are five times more likely to be out of school than other children in the countries to which they’ve been displaced.	我是中文句子
And in all but two African countries, girls remain less likely than boys to complete a primary education.	我是中文句子
Getting these children into school will require new approaches that directly address their exclusion and make schooling genuinely accessible and relevant.	我是中文句子
Second, “quality”: Education must be effective, so that children actually learn.	我是中文句子
For the 61 million children who are out of primary school, formal education is beyond reach.	我是中文句子
Half of these children have been in school for at least four years.	我是中文句子
We must address the barriers to learning, both in the classroom and at home, by improving the quality of teaching and classroom conditions and teaching parents how they can support their children’s education.	我是中文句子
Upholding these two principles will require increased investment.	我是中文句子
Last year, UNESCO calculated that governments must double education spending as a share of national income to achieve the 2030 goals.	我是中文句子
This will require increased revenue from taxation and stronger efforts to collect what’s owed.	我是中文句子
Donors also need to live up to their aid commitments and target aid more effectively.	我是中文句子
For example, less than one-third of education aid goes to Africa, even though the region accounts for almost two-thirds of out-of-school children.	我是中文句子
Moreover, at the moment, education budgets are often regressive, with almost half of spending in the poorest countries allocated to the most educated 10% of the population.	我是中文句子
Fixing education investment requires action in two key areas.	我是中文句子
First, we need equitable financing, with more investment in early childhood care and development, where there is the biggest potential for returns.	我是中文句子
Budgets must be focused on the most excluded children, and primary education must be free at the point of use, so that every child can learn.	我是中文句子
We also urgently need more transparency and accountability, so that budgets are visible and communities have a say in school governance.	我是中文句子
Our work will not be complete until that happens.	我是中文句子
Sustaining Progress in Transition Countries	我是中文句子
As a measure of economic maturity, the report confirms what many in the international development community have long known: the region is ascendant.	我是中文句子
Over the last decade, the economies of Eastern Europe and Central Asia have recorded spectacular gains, buttressed by ambitious market and public-sector reforms.	我是中文句子
The question now is how to ensure that this progress – which has tripled the size of the middle class – is sustained.	我是中文句子
Signs of the region’s social and economic prosperity are everywhere.	我是中文句子
Elsewhere, Estonia is the third country in Europe in startups per person and has one of the fastest Internet speeds anywhere.	我是中文句子
And from Albania to Kyrgyzstan, e-government systems are allowing more people to connect with critical services through online and electronic portals.	我是中文句子
To maintain momentum in meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, leaders must address three key issues.	我是中文句子
First, the region’s economies need to be strengthened to incentivize smarter, more sustainable growth.	我是中文句子
For example, fossil-fuel subsidies should be reconsidered, because they discourage investment in energy-efficiency projects, and impede the development of renewable technologies.	我是中文句子
Job creation is an urgent challenge for every state in the region.	我是中文句子
Second, in many countries, the space for civil society is becoming narrower, posing a threat to pluralism and accountability.	我是中文句子
To prevent conflict and give voice to the region’s marginalized groups, tolerance and respect for human rights must be made essential ingredients of governance.	我是中文句子
Finally, the region must coordinate on strategies to address the changes that automation and artificial intelligence will bring to the labor market.	我是中文句子
Leaders in some countries, particularly Belarus, are shifting economic output from heavy manufacturing to technology startups.	我是中文句子
But authorities everywhere can do more to increase the resilience of their workforces.	我是中文句子
In many countries, heads of government are using the SDGs to guide their national planning and efforts to legislate reforms.	我是中文句子
The parliaments of several Central Asian countries have even endorsed the SDGs as a development roadmap.	我是中文句子
Changes like these are helping to translate development ambition into action.	我是中文句子
Initial research efforts will focus on increasing the country’s tax collection, improving its education system, and boosting its renewable-energy sector.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, planning officials in Moldova have used crowdfunding to raise millions of dollars from the diaspora to fund sustainable development projects at home.	我是中文句子
Revitalization efforts have included the reconstruction of a public plaza in the capital, Chișinău, and the expansion of infrastructure in rural areas.	我是中文句子
The region’s private sector is also participating actively in sustainable development efforts.	我是中文句子
In only a few decades, the people of Eastern Europe and Central Asia have witnessed profound political and economic changes.	我是中文句子
To capitalize on the development progress already made, countries and organizations must learn from one another, adapting solutions to local conditions.	我是中文句子
As the new UNDP Strategic Plan for 2018-2021 argues, collaboration is a critical component to any sustainable-development strategy.	我是中文句子
If the measure of a country can be calculated by how easily business is conducted within its borders, the states of Eastern Europe and Central Asia have a bright future.	我是中文句子
With strong leadership that transforms the region’s economies and modernizes its institutions, the region’s recent gains will not be fleeting.	我是中文句子
The Achilles’ Heel of Trumponomics	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – Donald Trump’s economic strategy is severely flawed.	我是中文句子
The US president-elect wants to restore growth via deficit spending in a country with a chronic shortfall of saving.	我是中文句子
This points to a further compression in national saving, making a widening of an already outsize trade gap all but inevitable.	我是中文句子
The Trump administration will not inherit a strong and sound US economy.	我是中文句子
And savings, the seed corn of future prosperity, remain in woefully short supply.	我是中文句子
This is important because it explains the pernicious trade deficits that Trump continues to rail against.	我是中文句子
Lacking in saving and wanting to grow, the United States must import surplus saving from abroad.	我是中文句子
And the only way to attract that foreign capital is by running massive current-account and trade deficits.	我是中文句子
Trumponomics has the cause and effect behind this development backwards.	我是中文句子
The result would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on beleaguered middle-class US families.	我是中文句子
In short, there is no bilateral fix for a multilateral problem.	我是中文句子
That’s not to say that America’s trading partners should be let off the hook for unfair practices.	我是中文句子
Alas, this plot is about to thicken.	我是中文句子
Trumponomics seems likely to exacerbate America’s saving shortfall in the years ahead.	我是中文句子
Yet, as stressed above, barring a miraculous surge in national saving, this is highly dubious.	我是中文句子
Creative accounting, long a staple of supply-side economics, has never been more imaginative.	我是中文句子
Therein lies one of the most glaring disconnects of Trumponomics.	我是中文句子
Getting tough on trade at a time when national saving is about to come under ever-greater pressure simply doesn’t add up.	我是中文句子
Ironically, in the coming era of negative saving, the US will find itself increasingly dependent on surplus saving from abroad.	我是中文句子
If the Trump administration takes aim at major foreign lenders – namely, China – its strategy could quickly backfire.	我是中文句子
And, of course, there is the worst-case scenario of an escalating global trade war.	我是中文句子
Protectionism, anemic saving, and deficit spending make for an especially toxic cocktail.	我是中文句子
Under Trumponomics, it will be exceedingly difficult to make America great again.	我是中文句子
A Clarion Call for Emerging Markets	我是中文句子
They ignore this message at their peril.	我是中文句子
Emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000’s, and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse.	我是中文句子
But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum.	我是中文句子
Corruption takes many forms, but, in emerging markets, a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes.	我是中文句子
Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects.	我是中文句子
But the perception of this type of mega-corruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality.	我是中文句子
In countries like China and India, rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty.	我是中文句子
But the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared – the rich become super-rich, even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute.	我是中文句子
In many emerging markets, a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix.	我是中文句子
The combination of corruption, inequality, and political repression builds up enormous pressure, and there are no institutional channels through which to release it.	我是中文句子
But freer political regimes are not a panacea.	我是中文句子
In a democracy like India’s, the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth, thus increasing the resentment of those left behind.	我是中文句子
It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest, but economic factors are key.	我是中文句子
With swelling urban populations, it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures.	我是中文句子
Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression, information blackouts, or a combination of authoritarian measures.	我是中文句子
China, for example, blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests.	我是中文句子
The Arab Spring, however, reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows.	我是中文句子
The main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability.	我是中文句子
Tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability.	我是中文句子
These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps, and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being.	我是中文句子
These lessons apply equally to advanced economies, which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption.	我是中文句子
But, for those wealthy economies, restoring decent growth is now the major priority.	我是中文句子
Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption.	我是中文句子
As the past year’s events have shown, the costs of inaction could be calamitous.	我是中文句子
A Climate Deal is Not Enough	我是中文句子
AMSTERDAM – During the COP15 climate summit in Copenhagen, world leaders have been negotiating the future of our planet. All the signs suggest that they are unlikely to sign a global climate treaty.	我是中文句子
The politicians, civil servants, and other participants at the Copenhagen summit have mainly been bombarding each other with numbers.	我是中文句子
These are all very important issues.	我是中文句子
The climate issue can only be solved on the basis of shared, deeply felt ethical principles.	我是中文句子
Humanity has reached a critical moment in Earth’s history, at which peoples and nations will have to recognize their solidarity – with each other and with the Earth – and start acting upon it.	我是中文句子
The climate problem does not stop at borders.	我是中文句子
In the next few decades, a low-lying country like the Netherlands will need to invest billions of euros to intensify its age-old struggle against rising water.	我是中文句子
But in many other countries, the water is already flooding over the dikes, both literally and figuratively.	我是中文句子
Apart from the necessary, often infrastructural adaptations to survive the effects of climate change, enormous efforts to prevent even worse things from happening are required.	我是中文句子
Large investments in forestation, agriculture, and energy supply are called for.	我是中文句子
In devising solutions, the role of women should be the main focus.	我是中文句子
Women are often the first people who have to address the problem of gaining access to natural resources, and they are capable of playing a major role as pioneers in finding solutions to climate change and the way humankind should adapt to it.	我是中文句子
In the short term, the world should become a sustainable global society of low CO2 emitters.	我是中文句子
This is a mission for all humankind, in which patriotic feelings and thinking in terms of power blocs have no place.	我是中文句子
The pursuit of a sustainable global society of low CO2 emitters requires a tremendous effort.	我是中文句子
Precisely for this reason, it also requires a broadly shared ethical basis.	我是中文句子
This would guide the negotiating parties in such a way that they look not only for solutions to a part of the problem, but first and foremost at a comprehensive solution to the entire problem.	我是中文句子
The climate change issue is too important to be left in the care of politicians.	我是中文句子
A Communist Party without Communism	我是中文句子
It looks increasingly likely that, as under Leonid Brezhnev, we will see the same names in the news for decades to come.	我是中文句子
In the spirit of Schmitt, Putin’s men designated a liberal party, the Union of Right Forces, as their ur-enemy.	我是中文句子
Its public meetings were broken up by armed police; its leaders arrested and beaten; Putin called its supporters “coyotes.”	我是中文句子
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger.	我是中文句子
Oil prices are soaring, as are Putin’s approval ratings.	我是中文句子
His appointees control everything that matters, from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee.	我是中文句子
Yet their regime is in crisis, and they know it.	我是中文句子
Russia’s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.	我是中文句子
Military reform has been reversed.	我是中文句子
Despite increasing incomes, Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power; they still die at a shockingly young age.	我是中文句子
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption.	我是中文句子
State monopolies undo what private businesses created.	我是中文句子
With more money, ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats; as a result, the regime fails to rule the country.	我是中文句子
The country is unruly, and its rulers know it.	我是中文句子
So they panic.	我是中文句子
Putin’s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia’s security forces.	我是中文句子
His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it “directed and controlled,” including the KGB.	我是中文句子
Under Putin, the security service has had its revenge.	我是中文句子
Its people have become powerful, arrogant, and enormously rich.	我是中文句子
They have also become disobedient.	我是中文句子
This essay, more than anything else, defined Putin’s second term.	我是中文句子
Earlier, generals from a competing service, the FSB, had arrested Cherkesov’s deputy for “illegal bugging.”	我是中文句子
In a public gesture of despair, Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin’s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services.	我是中文句子
Cherkesov’s deputy remains in prison.	我是中文句子
Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense.	我是中文句子
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin’s circle also confronts this situation.	我是中文句子
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another?	我是中文句子
Cherkesov’s case exemplifies Putin’s nightmare.	我是中文句子
But if your instincts betray you, you go back to even deeper ones.	我是中文句子
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction.	我是中文句子
Preaching nationalism, its managers will believe in their universal competence, as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism.	我是中文句子
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree.	我是中文句子
Integrated by the leader’s charisma and party discipline, party members will direct and unify the desolated country.	我是中文句子
This is Putin’s plan.	我是中文句子
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, the only other KGB man to rule Russia, Putin will become the party’s general secretary.	我是中文句子
And, of course, being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit.	我是中文句子
In the end, Putin has what history left him: not ideas, just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power.	我是中文句子
It is a bizarre ideology.	我是中文句子
Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves, it shuns its Marxist origins.	我是中文句子
A Confederal Solution for Palestine	我是中文句子
LONDON – Last month, while in New York City, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.	我是中文句子
To accommodate his security needs, the hotel had been converted into a fortress, much like Israel itself.	我是中文句子
Netanyahu was in the United States for yet another round of Middle East peace talks.	我是中文句子
The US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another 90 days.	我是中文句子
The Israelis refused; another impasse was reached.	我是中文句子
What, then, might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land?	我是中文句子
The answer is: very poor.	我是中文句子
A negotiated “land for peace” solution still remains official Western doctrine.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, the two main parties to the dispute, Palestine and Israel, are searching for unilateral alternatives to the stymied “peace process.”	我是中文句子
The Palestinians are pushing for international recognition of their statehood, while the Israelis are using their settlement policy to preempt a Palestinian state.	我是中文句子
This month, Brazil and Argentina recognized “Palestine,” and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow.	我是中文句子
Abbas is now setting his sights on Europe, and would ask Turkey to serve as a go-between.	我是中文句子
The game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to pressure the US to retreat from its almost unconditional support for Israeli policy.	我是中文句子
Israel’s main concern continues to be security.	我是中文句子
The official Western doctrine is that Israel’s long-term security depends on the success of the “peace process.”	我是中文句子
In practice, Israel has been taking other measures to secure its future.	我是中文句子
Media attention has been focused on the “security wall,” which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence.	我是中文句子
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states, but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the two-state solution was always an illusion.	我是中文句子
There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate possessiveness of all those with claims to it.	我是中文句子
Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper.	我是中文句子
Moreover, land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view.	我是中文句子
The free movement of goods, labor, and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to Palestinian GDP.	我是中文句子
It could also have been the basis of a confederal state, whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers’ productivity and taxes.	我是中文句子
But this benign prospect was undermined by the violence needed to maintain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one.	我是中文句子
The official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-state settlement will bring about the security needed for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories.	我是中文句子
Netanyahu’s project is not moral.	我是中文句子
But that doesn’t mean that it won’t work, at least for a time.	我是中文句子
A Confederation for Kosovo	我是中文句子
Time is running out in Kosovo.	我是中文句子
That would be a disastrous step.	我是中文句子
Serbia is even more strongly opposed.	我是中文句子
Dusan Prorokovic, Serbia’s state secretary for Kosovo, has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty.	我是中文句子
After eight years of international administration, Kosovo’s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence.	我是中文句子
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition.	我是中文句子
Serbia is prepared to concede only “enhanced autonomy” to Kosovo, and some capacity to enter into international agreements.	我是中文句子
Yet, while the two parties now seem irreconcilable, it is not too late for compromise.	我是中文句子
But this is possible only by resuscitating – and updating – an old institution of the international community: a confederation of states.	我是中文句子
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood.	我是中文句子
As with any compromise, the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement.	我是中文句子
The EU would benefit as well, by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area.	我是中文句子
Subsequently, the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent.	我是中文句子
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary.	我是中文句子
A Cool Calculus of Global Warming	我是中文句子
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1% of annual consumption, but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater.	我是中文句子
Still, some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be, we should do little or nothing.	我是中文句子
To me, uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today, not less.	我是中文句子
Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large.	我是中文句子
Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend.	我是中文句子
As the Stern report points out, as usual, the poor are the most vulnerable.	我是中文句子
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century.	我是中文句子
The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear: our twenty-first-century Atlantis.	我是中文句子
To an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause.	我是中文句子
Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions.	我是中文句子
The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm, but no war could be more devastating.	我是中文句子
A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate.	我是中文句子
This does not mean an increase in overall taxation, but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution (carbon) tax for some current taxes.	我是中文句子
It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad, like pollution, than things that are good, like savings and work.	我是中文句子
Although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets, in this case he has called for voluntary action.	我是中文句子
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean.	我是中文句子
Most importantly, price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation.	我是中文句子
Small changes in practices, when replicated by hundreds of millions of people, can make an enormous difference.	我是中文句子
For example, simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning.	我是中文句子
We have but one planet, and should treasure it.	我是中文句子
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore.	我是中文句子
A Cool Head for the Hottest Issues	我是中文句子
This is not to say that he is unemotional.	我是中文句子
Obama can rage and weep.	我是中文句子
But he rarely seems to act on the basis of raw sentiment or instinctive prejudice.	我是中文句子
Pragmatic and highly intelligent, sooner or later every issue receives the full attention of his forensic curiosity.	我是中文句子
He would not be afraid to act, but he would be prepared to think first.	我是中文句子
Obama was praised extravagantly a year ago; 12 months on, the criticism is over the top, too.	我是中文句子
Obama inherited a terrible legacy – recession, financial meltdown, Iraq, Afghanistan. He has not solved all of these problems.	我是中文句子
That seems to be changing now.	我是中文句子
The left in America criticizes Obama for not turning the economy around already.	我是中文句子
The right angrily denounces him as a crypto-communist because he wants every American to have health care.	我是中文句子
With a dispassionate eye on the long game, what will the president himself be thinking?	我是中文句子
One issue that Obama is certain to have in his sights is a problem that shadowed the world for years.	我是中文句子
When I was growing up in the 1950’s and 1960’s, world peace was based on the nuclear standoff between the US and the Soviet Union.	我是中文句子
We have forgotten those days.	我是中文句子
Yet there are still 23,000 nuclear warheads on our planet, with the explosive power of 150,000 Hiroshima bombs.	我是中文句子
Terrorist groups would undoubtedly like to get their hands on one.	我是中文句子
In all, there are eight nuclear-weapon states – the US, Russia, Britain, France, China, Israel, India, and Pakistan.	我是中文句子
North Korea may also have a few bombs. Iran is believed by many to be trying to develop one.	我是中文句子
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has contained the number of nuclear states.	我是中文句子
A conference is to be held in May to renew and review it.	我是中文句子
This is principally an issue for the US and Russia, which possess 95% of the world’s nuclear weapons.	我是中文句子
In addition, it would help if the US could take a strong lead by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.	我是中文句子
The nuclear issue is one of the biggest items on the Obama agenda. How it is handled will help to define his presidency.	我是中文句子
Even before the talking gets serious in May, there will be the question of Iran to sort out.	我是中文句子
Iran says that it seeks no more than its own ability to produce nuclear power.	我是中文句子
The US, the European Union, and Russia have tried to engage Iran on this issue, so far without success.	我是中文句子
China seems likely to block effective sanctions on Iran because of its close energy relationship with the country.	我是中文句子
How China eventually handles this will profoundly affect its standing in the US and Europe.	我是中文句子
These are going to be some of the major questions for Obama over the next year and more.	我是中文句子
If he gets them right, he can forget about his short-term critics.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, he is smart enough to know this.	我是中文句子
A Crisis in Full Flight	我是中文句子
But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again, closing in on about 6%.	我是中文句子
Of course, this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable.	我是中文句子
After all, interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10% in the decade before the euro was introduced.	我是中文句子
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6%.	我是中文句子
Nevertheless, the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden.	我是中文句子
Since July 2011, Spain’s TARGET debt has grown by €199 billion.	我是中文句子
Capital is in full flight, more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010.	我是中文句子
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year (2008) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press.	我是中文句子
The picture is little better in Italy, where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2% of GDP to a 3%-of-GDP deficit over the last ten years.	我是中文句子
Italy, too, is being drained of capital; in fact, the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB’s liquidity injection.	我是中文句子
The purpose of the ECB’s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market.	我是中文句子
In this, too, it has not really been successful, despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table.	我是中文句子
Indeed, now the French are looking wobbly.	我是中文句子
As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012, France’s TARGET debt increased by €95 billion.	我是中文句子
France, too, has become uncompetitive, owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years.	我是中文句子
Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15%, and Spain by roughly 20%.	我是中文句子
These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort, if at all, and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation.	我是中文句子
For Greece and Portugal, staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze.	我是中文句子
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup.	我是中文句子
Such systems cannot work, because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system’s main steering mechanism.	我是中文句子
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe’s politicians have started down this slippery slope.	我是中文句子
A Crisis in Two Narratives	我是中文句子
CHICAGO – With the world’s industrial democracies in crisis, two competing narratives of its sources – and appropriate remedies – are emerging.	我是中文句子
The first, better-known diagnosis is that demand has collapsed because of high debt accumulated prior to the crisis.	我是中文句子
Households (and countries) that were most prone to spend cannot borrow any more.	我是中文句子
Under these circumstances, budgetary recklessness is a virtue, at least in the short term.	我是中文句子
Its virtue is that it gives policymakers something clear to do, with promised returns that match the political cycle.	我是中文句子
More such spending will not return these countries to a sustainable growth path.	我是中文句子
Instead, they must improve the environment for growth.	我是中文句子
The second narrative starts with the 1950’s and 1960’s, an era of rapid growth in the West and Japan.	我是中文句子
But, when growth faltered, this meant that government spending expanded, even as its resources shrank.	我是中文句子
For a while, central banks accommodated that spending.	我是中文句子
The resulting high inflation created widespread discontent, especially because little growth resulted.	我是中文句子
Faith in Keynesian stimulus diminished, though high inflation did reduce public-debt levels.	我是中文句子
Central banks then began to focus on low and stable inflation as their primary objective, and became more independent from their political masters.	我是中文句子
Public debt continued to grow.	我是中文句子
And the incomes of the moderately educated middle class failed to benefit from deregulation-led growth (though it improved their lot as consumers).	我是中文句子
The most recent phase of the advanced economies’ frenzied search for growth took different forms.	我是中文句子
In the US, the imperative is to improve the match between potential jobs and worker skills.	我是中文句子
People understand better than the government what they need and are acting accordingly.	我是中文句子
Many women, for example, are leaving low-paying jobs to acquire skills that will open doors to higher-paying positions.	我是中文句子
Tax reform, however, can provide spur retraining and maintain incentives to work, even while fixing gaping fiscal holes.	我是中文句子
The advanced countries have a choice.	我是中文句子
They can act as if all is well, except that their consumers are in a funk, and that “animal spirits” must be revived through stimulus.	我是中文句子
Or they can treat the crisis as a wake-up call to fix what debt has papered over in the last few decades.	我是中文句子
For better or worse, the narrative that persuades these countries’ governments and publics will determine their future – and that of the global economy.	我是中文句子
Financing the Next Development Agenda	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – As the 2015 target date for the Millennium Development Goals approaches, the United Nations is intensifying its efforts to foster debate about what comes next for promotion of development worldwide.	我是中文句子
The outcome of these discussions will shape policies and investment aimed at spurring GDP growth, strengthening human capital, and promoting more inclusive prosperity.	我是中文句子
Both factors challenge us to define, in the longer term, more sustainable patterns of production and consumption.	我是中文句子
Governments, civil society, and the private sector must rise to the challenge, cooperating to find and implement creative solutions.	我是中文句子
To start, governments should design targeted, evidence-based policies and support the development of sound institutions.	我是中文句子
This would make government services more effective, while helping to catalyze additional development aid from traditional donors and mobilize private-sector resources.	我是中文句子
In many countries, there is considerable scope for domestic resource mobilization.	我是中文句子
More equitable taxation would have a positive impact on governance, another important tool for mobilizing domestic resources.	我是中文句子
Progress in these areas would help governments to channel their spending more effectively toward those who would benefit the most.	我是中文句子
For example, only 8% of the $409 billion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies in 2010 reached the poorest 20% of the population.	我是中文句子
A targeted support program could increase substantially the efficiency of spending, freeing up resources for education, health, and poverty eradication.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, promoting financial deepening and inclusiveness could accelerate private-sector growth, creating more opportunities.	我是中文句子
A deeper and more efficient financial sector would also reduce transaction costs and facilitate risk management.	我是中文句子
Local-currency bond markets could help to develop domestic investor bases and mobilize domestic savings to support long-term investments.	我是中文句子
At the same time, the international community should work to improve the availability and effectiveness of official development assistance.	我是中文句子
They can also take steps to make ODA more predictable from year to year.	我是中文句子
Donors should structure aid to ensure that it supports sound national development policies and programs, rather than their own narrow interests.	我是中文句子
More generally, improving coordination among donors would help to maximize the impact of aid on the ground.	我是中文句子
Attracting even a fraction of the assets held by institutional investors, sovereign-wealth funds, and public pension funds could boost development finance substantially.	我是中文句子
Diaspora populations are another major potential source of development financing.	我是中文句子
Tailoring financial products for diaspora communities could attract resources for investment, while reinforcing migrants’ ties – economic and otherwise – to their home countries.	我是中文句子
Finally, the international community bears a special responsibility for delivering global public goods.	我是中文句子
Investment in statistical capacity would help governments and businesses worldwide to make better policy decisions, based on a more accurate accounting of the associated costs and benefits.	我是中文句子
The challenge of the post-2015 development agenda lies in finding creative solutions to support prosperity, equality, and sustainability.	我是中文句子
Together, governments, civil society, international organizations, and the private sector can improve the availability and quality of finance for development, and shape a better future for all.	我是中文句子
A Czech Moment	我是中文句子
The reality is that there is no such thing as “old and new” Europe, and there never was.	我是中文句子
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old.	我是中文句子
We Czechs are 100% European, and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe.	我是中文句子
Indeed, our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union, like our freedom, is so comparatively new.	我是中文句子
So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity – true union – will be needed.	我是中文句子
The primary, and most pressing, of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve.	我是中文句子
It will fall to the Union, once again, to help transform despair into hope.	我是中文句子
To contain today’s financial and economic crisis, Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point.	我是中文句子
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check.	我是中文句子
For now, EU governments’ coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals.	我是中文句子
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate.	我是中文句子
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia.	我是中文句子
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated.	我是中文句子
Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year, but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold.	我是中文句子
Now those talks have resumed, but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically.	我是中文句子
Russia’s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members.	我是中文句子
Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia.	我是中文句子
Indeed, many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia’s closest friend in the Union.	我是中文句子
When the Georgia crisis erupted, Europe united around a single position on Russia’s withdrawal.	我是中文句子
It is the Czech Republic’s task, and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own, to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward.	我是中文句子
We, like all EU presidencies, will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate.	我是中文句子
In Praise of Fragmentation	我是中文句子
LONDON – Emerging markets are back in the spotlight.	我是中文句子
Investors and banks are suddenly unwilling to finance current-account deficits with short-term debt.	我是中文句子
South Africa, for example, has had to increase interest rates, despite slow economic growth, to attract the funding it needs.	我是中文句子
Turkey’s rate increase has been dramatic.	我是中文句子
For these and other emerging countries, 2014 may prove to be a turbulent year.	我是中文句子
But the fundamental question is how to manage the impact of short-term capital inflows.	我是中文句子
Until recently, economic orthodoxy considered that question invalid.	我是中文句子
Financial liberalization was lauded because it enabled capital to flow to where it would be used most productively, increasing national and global growth.	我是中文句子
But empirical support for the benefits of capital-account liberalization is weak.	我是中文句子
Likewise, most cross-country studies have found no evidence that capital-account liberalization is good for growth.	我是中文句子
The case for liberalizing trade in goods and services is strong; the case for complete capital-account liberalization is not.	我是中文句子
One reason is that many modern financial flows do not play the useful role in capital allocation that economic theory assumes.	我是中文句子
But in today’s world, net capital flows are often from relatively poor countries to rich countries.	我是中文句子
Moreover, capital inflows frequently finance consumption or unsustainable real-estate booms.	我是中文句子
And yet, despite the growing evidence to the contrary, the assumption that all capital flows are beneficial has proved remarkably resilient.	我是中文句子
That reflects the power not only of vested interests but also of established ideas.	我是中文句子
Empirical falsification of a prevailing orthodoxy is disturbing.	我是中文句子
It is time to stop looking for these non-existent benefits, and to distinguish among different categories of capital flows.	我是中文句子
Some are valuable, but some are potentially harmful.	我是中文句子
Equity portfolio investment may involve price volatility as ownership positions change, but at least it implies a permanent commitment of capital to a business enterprise.	我是中文句子
Long-term debt finance of real capital investment can play a useful role as well.	我是中文句子
What is less clear is the best policy response.	我是中文句子
Capital controls are invariably porous, and we cannot gain the benefits of free trade and FDI without creating some opportunities for short-term investor positioning.	我是中文句子
But while perfect policy is unattainable, partly effective controls can still play a useful role if targeted at the interface between short-term inflows and domestic credit cycles.	我是中文句子
After all, capital inflows cause the greatest harm when they drive rapid increases in credit-financed consumption or real-estate speculation.	我是中文句子
The required policy response should integrate domestic financial regulation with capital-account management.	我是中文句子
Neither mandatory subsidiarization nor tax- or regulation-based capital controls will solve all of the problems.	我是中文句子
But, taken together, they can stem the volatility implied by short-term flows and help to smooth out domestic credit cycles.	我是中文句子
Much of the financial industry resists such measures, as do the many economists who remain wedded to the old orthodoxy.	我是中文句子
Renewed capital controls, they claim, would “fragment” the global financial market, undermining its ability to allocate capital efficiently.	我是中文句子
In the past, policymakers have been at pains to stress that no such fragmentation will be allowed.	我是中文句子
But we need to be blunt: Free flows of short-term debt can result in capital misallocation and harmful instability.	我是中文句子
When it comes to global capital markets, fragmentation can be a good thing.	我是中文句子
The High-Tech, High-Touch Economy	我是中文句子
LONDON – A recent report revealed that the five richest families in Britain are worth more than the country’s poorest 20% combined.	我是中文句子
Urban land wealth is not just a London phenomenon.	我是中文句子
That might seem odd.	我是中文句子
Though we live in the hi-tech virtual world of the Internet, the value of the most physical thing – land – is rising relentlessly.	我是中文句子
But there is no contradiction: The price of land is rising because of rapid technological progress.	我是中文句子
In an age of information and communication technology (ICT), it is inevitable that we value what an ICT-intensive economy cannot create.	我是中文句子
One consequence is the striking phenomenon of huge wealth creation with very little labor input.	我是中文句子
Facebook has an equity valuation of $170 billion but employs only around 6,000 people.	我是中文句子
The investment that went into building the software that runs it entailed no more than around 5,000 software engineer man-years.	我是中文句子
This remarkable technology has helped to deliver increasing average incomes and will continue to do so.	我是中文句子
But the distribution of that bounty has been very unequal.	我是中文句子
The lion’s share of the growth has gone to the top half, the top 10%, or even the top 1% of the population.	我是中文句子
As the better off become richer, however, much of their rising income will not be spent on ICT-intensive goods and services.	我是中文句子
There is a limit to how many iPads and smart phones one can need, and their price continues to plummet.	我是中文句子
Instead, an increasing share of consumer expenditure is devoted to buying goods and services that are rich in fashion, design, and subjective brand values, and to competing for ownership of location-specific real estate.	我是中文句子
But if the land on which the desired houses and apartments sit is in limited supply, the inevitable consequence is rising prices.	我是中文句子
Urban land is therefore rising in value – in London, New York, Shanghai, and many other cities – partly because of consumer demand.	我是中文句子
But its rising value also makes it an attractive asset class for investors, because further price increases are expected.	我是中文句子
Moreover, returns on real estate have been swollen by the dramatic fall in interest rates over the last 25 years, a decline that was far advanced even before the 2008 financial crisis.	我是中文句子
The cause of those low interest rates is debated; but one probable factor is the reduced cost of business investment in hardware and software-based “machines.”	我是中文句子
If you can build a $170 billion company with just 5,000 software engineer man-years, you don’t need to borrow much money.	我是中文句子
This economy is the result of our remarkable ability to solve the problem of production and automate away the need for continual labor.	我是中文句子
But it is an economy that is likely to suffer two adverse side effects.	我是中文句子
Major changes in financial and monetary policy, going far beyond those introduced in response to the 2008 crisis, are required to contain this danger.	我是中文句子
The Trade Delusion	我是中文句子
LONDON – Since 2008, global trade has grown slightly more slowly than global GDP.	我是中文句子
The Doha Round of World Trade Organization negotiations ended in failure.	我是中文句子
Transatlantic and transpacific trade negotiations are progressing slowly, held back by the resistance of special interests.	我是中文句子
The creation of Europe’s single market facilitated increased intra-European trade.	我是中文句子
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan achieved rapid economic catch-up on the basis of export-led growth.	我是中文句子
China has followed the same path over the last 30 years.	我是中文句子
Trade grew about twice as fast as global output from 1990 to 2008.	我是中文句子
But there is no reason why trade should grow faster than GDP forever.	我是中文句子
Indeed, even if there were no trade barriers at all, trade might grow significantly more slowly than GDP in some periods.	我是中文句子
Several factors make it possible that we are entering such a period.	我是中文句子
For starters, there is the changing pattern of consumption in the advanced economies.	我是中文句子
Non-tradable sectors tend to account for a growing share of employment and economic activity.	我是中文句子
In the future, however, the shift to non-tradable consumption may dominate.	我是中文句子
Indeed, trade intensity may decline even for manufactured goods.	我是中文句子
Trade is partly driven by differences in labor costs.	我是中文句子
China’s dramatic manufacturing growth reflected low wages up to now.	我是中文句子
But as real wages in China and other emerging economies grow, incentives for trade will decline.	我是中文句子
The more that global incomes converge, the less trade there may be.	我是中文句子
Global trade as a share of GDP may therefore decline, but without adverse consequences for global economic growth.	我是中文句子
Rising productivity does not require relentlessly increasing trade intensity.	我是中文句子
Earth, after all, does not trade with other planets, yet its economy still grows.	我是中文句子
Optimal trade intensity depends on many factors – such as relative labor costs, transport costs, productivity levels, and economy-of-scale effects.	我是中文句子
Trends in these factors might make reduced trade intensity not only inevitable but desirable.	我是中文句子
Even if that is true, international trade will still play a vital role, and preventing any reversal of past trade liberalization is essential.	我是中文句子
But further trade liberalization is bound to be of declining importance to economic growth.	我是中文句子
With industrial tariffs already dramatically reduced most potential benefits of trade liberalization have already been grasped.	我是中文句子
Estimates of the benefits of further trade liberalization are often surprisingly low – no more than a few percentage points of global GDP.	我是中文句子
This implies that further progress in trade liberalization will be slow.	我是中文句子
That reality often goes unacknowledged.	我是中文句子
The importance of past trade liberalization has left the global policy establishment with a bias toward assuming that further liberalization would bring similar benefits.	我是中文句子
But while the potential global benefits of trade liberalization have declined, reduced trade intensity might still impede economic development in some countries.	我是中文句子
Relying solely on that model will be more difficult in the future.	我是中文句子
That poses important challenges for development policy, which further trade liberalization can alleviate only marginally.	我是中文句子
Rethinking the Monetization Taboo	我是中文句子
To many, a larger issue needs to be addressed.	我是中文句子
The Fed’s tapering merely slows the growth of its balance sheet.	我是中文句子
The authorities would still have to sell $3 trillion of bonds to return to the pre-crisis status quo.	我是中文句子
The rarely admitted truth, however, is that there is no need for central banks’ balance sheets to shrink.	我是中文句子
They could stay permanently larger; and, for some countries, permanently bigger central-bank balance sheets will help reduce public-debt burdens.	我是中文句子
But if a central bank owns the debt of its own government, no net public liability exists.	我是中文句子
The government owns the central bank, so the debt is to itself, and the interest expense comes back to the government as the central bank’s profit.	我是中文句子
This amounts to “helicopter money” after the fact.	我是中文句子
This, he argued, was bound to increase national income, because the direct stimulative effect would not be offset by concern about future debt burdens.	我是中文句子
His advice was not followed; large Japanese deficits were in fact bond-financed.	我是中文句子
But the debts held by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could still be written off.	我是中文句子
Objections focus on two risks: central-bank losses and excessive inflation.	我是中文句子
But both of these outcomes can be avoided.	我是中文句子
Central banks have bought government bonds with money on which they currently pay zero or very low interest rates.	我是中文句子
So, as interest rates rise, central banks might face costs exceeding their income.	我是中文句子
But central banks can choose to pay zero interest on a portion of the reserves that commercial banks hold with them, even when they increase the policy interest rate.	我是中文句子
Permanent monetization of government debts is undoubtedly technically possible.	我是中文句子
Whether it is desirable depends on the outlook for inflation.	我是中文句子
Where inflation is returning to target levels, debt monetization could be unnecessarily and dangerously stimulative.	我是中文句子
Central-bank bond sales, while certainly not inevitable, may be appropriate.	我是中文句子
But if deflation is the danger, permanent monetization may be the best policy.	我是中文句子
I predict that Japan will, in effect, permanently monetize some government debt.	我是中文句子
That will not happen, and any attempt to reach that target would drive Japan into a severe depression.	我是中文句子
But the government does not need to repay the ¥140 trillion ($1.4 trillion) of its debt that the BoJ already owns.	我是中文句子
The BoJ will continue to increase its balance sheet until it achieves its 2% inflation target.	我是中文句子
It is precisely what happened to the Fed’s balance sheet after its wartime and postwar buying of US government bonds came to an end in 1951.	我是中文句子
Even as permanent monetization occurs, however, the truth may be obfuscated.	我是中文句子
Central banks can monetize debt while pretending not to.	我是中文句子
The historical experience of Weimar Germany, or that of Zimbabwe today, illustrates the danger.	我是中文句子
Such reticence may serve a useful purpose.	我是中文句子
But it must not blind central banks and governments to the full range of policy tools available to address today’s severe debt overhangs.	我是中文句子
The Perils of Financial Freedom	我是中文句子
Today, the imbalance remains, with the economy too focused on investment and too dependent on credit.	我是中文句子
But, while stronger market discipline is needed in some areas, Chinese officials should be under no illusion that free markets are a panacea for the financial sector.	我是中文句子
Indeed, China’s current economic imbalances partly reflect the dangers created by competition in credit markets.	我是中文句子
But the huge credit stimulus introduced in 2009 drove the economy further in the opposite direction.	我是中文句子
Both China and the global economy benefited from that stimulus, which helped prop up overall demand in dangerously deflationary times.	我是中文句子
But it has led to significant wasted investment in heavy industry, real estate, and urban infrastructure, and leaves China facing the challenge of deleveraging and working out bad debts.	我是中文句子
In many areas, improved market discipline does have an important role to play in addressing the structural causes of imbalance.	我是中文句子
Wasteful construction investment is encouraged by the under-pricing of rural land.	我是中文句子
The lack of a normal ownership relationship between the central government and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) allows the latter to pay minimal dividends and over-invest in business expansion.	我是中文句子
Caps on interest rates on bank deposits result in household savers supplying a large subsidy to corporate borrowers.	我是中文句子
And SOEs have better access to credit from state-owned banks than private companies do.	我是中文句子
But the belief that financial liberalization will provide an easy route to a balanced and stable economy is a delusion, as Japan’s experience in the 1980’s illustrates.	我是中文句子
This reflects the interaction of two distinctively Chinese factors and one inherent feature of all banking systems.	我是中文句子
The first Chinese factor is the authorities’ focus on “urbanization” as an end in itself, rather than as a byproduct of industrialization.	我是中文句子
The second is China’s decentralized approach to economic development, with strong competition between regions and cities often focusing on prestige urban infrastructure projects.	我是中文句子
These factors will drive construction booms and busts even if obvious market distortions are removed and market discipline is tightened.	我是中文句子
The pre-crisis Irish and Spanish banking systems proved just as capable as Chinese state-owned banks at funding excessive real-estate construction.	我是中文句子
Caps on loan-to-value or loan-to-income ratios on real-estate loans should be used aggressively.	我是中文句子
Capital requirements for banks should reflect higher risk weights for real-estate lending than banks’ private assessments of credit risks suggest are appropriate.	我是中文句子
Credit provision by shadow banks needs to be tightly regulated.	我是中文句子
The credit cycle is too important to be left to free markets.	我是中文句子
China thus faces a difficult challenge.	我是中文句子
How smoothly that transition occurs matters for the whole world.	我是中文句子
By the early 2020’s, China’s GDP will be $20 trillion.	我是中文句子
Today, much of that debt represents claims within the state sector – owed, for instance, by SOEs to state-owned banks.	我是中文句子
One hopes that the Chinese authorities understand the dangers as well as the benefits of free financial markets better than advanced-economy policymakers did ahead of the 2008 crisis.	我是中文句子
If not, another crisis – far more severe than the last – may become inevitable.	我是中文句子
The Great Credit Mistake	我是中文句子
LONDON – Before the financial crisis erupted in 2008, private credit in most developed economies grew faster than GDP.	我是中文句子
Then credit growth collapsed.	我是中文句子
Whether that fall reflected low demand for credit or constrained supply may seem like a technical issue.	我是中文句子
But the answer holds important implications for policymaking and prospects for economic growth.	我是中文句子
And the official answer is probably wrong.	我是中文句子
The prevailing view has usually stressed supply constraints and the policies needed to fix them.	我是中文句子
An impaired banking system, it is argued, starves businesses, particularly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), of the funds they need to expand.	我是中文句子
In September 2008, US President George W. Bush wanted to “free up banks to resume the flow of credit to American families and businesses.”	我是中文句子
The stress tests and recapitalizations of US banks in 2009 were subsequently hailed as crucial to the recovery of both the banking system and the economy.	我是中文句子
By contrast, the European Central Bank’s inadequately tough stress tests in 2010 were widely panned for leaving eurozone banks too weak to provide adequate credit.	我是中文句子
Taxpayer-funded bank rescues, higher bank capital requirements, and ultra-easy monetary policy have all been vital to overcome credit supply constraints.	我是中文句子
But there is strong evidence that once the immediate crisis was over, lack of demand for credit played a far larger role than restricted supply in impeding economic growth.	我是中文句子
It was in those US counties, too, that local businesses cut employment most aggressively.	我是中文句子
For SMEs, a shortage of customers, not a shortage of credit, constrained borrowing, employment, and output.	我是中文句子
And the customers were absent because the pre-crisis credit boom had left them over-leveraged.	我是中文句子
In the UK, many business surveys from 2009-2012 told the same story.	我是中文句子
Poor customer demand was ranked well ahead of credit availability as a constraint on growth.	我是中文句子
Economic growth can indeed continue to be severely depressed by a debt overhang even when credit supply is unrestricted and cheap.	我是中文句子
Many Japanese companies were left overleveraged by the boom and bust in credit and real estate in the 1980s and early 1990s.	我是中文句子
By the late 1990s, the Japanese banking system was offering companies loans at near-zero interest rates.	我是中文句子
But, rather than borrow to invest, firms cut investment to pay down debt, driving two decades of stagnation and deflation.	我是中文句子
Major progress in fixing these problems has already been achieved.	我是中文句子
Simultaneous private deleveraging and fiscal consolidation are restricting eurozone growth far more than remaining restrictions on credit supply.	我是中文句子
That reflects a recurring tendency in official policy debates, particularly in the eurozone, to concentrate on fixable problems to the exclusion of more difficult issues.	我是中文句子
Fixing impaired banking systems after a crisis is both essential and achievable.	我是中文句子
By contrast, a large debt overhang may be intractable unless policy orthodoxies are challenged.	我是中文句子
Japan offset private deleveraging in the 1990s by running massive public deficits.	我是中文句子
But fiscal stimulus is constrained within the eurozone, where member countries no longer issue their own currency and “sovereign” debt therefore carries a default risk.	我是中文句子
To survive and thrive, the eurozone will need to become more centralized, with some common fiscal revenues, expenditures, and debts.	我是中文句子
Of course, this scenario implies immensely difficult political choices.	我是中文句子
But the starting point for debate must be realism about the nature and severity of the problems facing the eurozone.	我是中文句子
Inequality by the Click	我是中文句子
Is he right?	我是中文句子
In one sense, Francis was clearly wrong: in many cases, inequality between countries is decreasing.	我是中文句子
The average Chinese household, for example, is now catching up with the average American household (though still with a long way to go).	我是中文句子
But such examples do not negate the importance of rising inequality within countries.	我是中文句子
Both China and the United States are dramatically unequal societies – and are becoming more so.	我是中文句子
In the US, the statistics are striking at both ends of the income distribution.	我是中文句子
The bottom quarter of US households have received almost no increase in real (inflation-adjusted) income for the last 25 years.	我是中文句子
They are no longer sharing the fruits of their country’s growth.	我是中文句子
Globalization explains some of the bottom-quarter income stagnation in the US and other developed economies.	我是中文句子
Competition from lower-paid Chinese workers has driven down US wages.	我是中文句子
But technological change may be a more fundamental factor – and one with consequences for all countries.	我是中文句子
Technological change is the essence of economic growth.	我是中文句子
We get richer because we figure out how to maintain or increase output with fewer employees, and because innovation creates new products and services.	我是中文句子
Successful new technologies always cause job losses in some sectors, which are offset by new jobs elsewhere.	我是中文句子
Tractors destroyed millions of agricultural jobs, for example, but tractor, truck, and car manufacturers created millions of new ones.	我是中文句子
But new technologies come in subtly different forms, with inherently different economic consequences.	我是中文句子
Today’s new technologies may have far more troubling distributional effects than those of the electromechanical age.	我是中文句子
Provided she secured intellectual-property rights, the inventor would have become the richest person in the world; and her lawyers and those who provided her with luxury goods and services would have become pretty rich, too.	我是中文句子
But, beyond that, no new jobs would have been created.	我是中文句子
Information and communication technology is not costless magic; but it is closer to it than were the innovations of the electromechanical age.	我是中文句子
The cost of computing hardware collapses over time in line with Moore’s law of relentlessly increasing processing power.	我是中文句子
And once software has been developed, the marginal cost of copying it is effectively zero.	我是中文句子
But the number of jobs created is trivial, too.	我是中文句子
In 1979, General Motors employed 850,000 workers.	我是中文句子
But increased unemployment is not inevitable.	我是中文句子
There is no limit to the number of service jobs that we can create in retail, restaurants and catering, hotels, and an enormous variety of personal services.	我是中文句子
But the wages that the market will set for these jobs may result in yet greater inequality.	我是中文句子
And there is no reason to believe that politicians’ all-purpose answer to the problem – “increase workforce skills” – will offset this tendency.	我是中文句子
However many people learn superior IT skills, Facebook will never need more than a few thousand employees.	我是中文句子
And access to high-paid jobs is likely to be determined not by absolute skill level, but by relative skill in a winner-take-all world.	我是中文句子
At least, however, IT products and services are very cheap, so even the relatively poor can afford them.	我是中文句子
That might make very unequal societies more stable than many fear.	我是中文句子
Cowen may be right; the poor may not rebel.	我是中文句子
But extreme inequality should still concern us.	我是中文句子
All new technologies create opportunities, but free markets will distribute the fruits of some new technologies in dramatically unequal ways.	我是中文句子
Offsetting such outcomes will be a greater challenge today than it has been in the past.	我是中文句子
Protectionist Shadows over Solar Power	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, the settlement is a bad outcome for consumers – and for the environment.	我是中文句子
The China-EU dispute parallels a similar one between China and the United States.	我是中文句子
The solar-panel disputes may sound narrow and esoteric, but they go to the heart of the long-running debate over globalization.	我是中文句子
Anti-globalization activists’ most powerful argument is that even if free trade is good for economic progress overall, it might undermine important public goods such as environmental protection.	我是中文句子
Under the well-known “race to the bottom” hypothesis, countries that are open to international trade are thought to adopt weaker environmental regulations than less open countries do.	我是中文句子
But trade can also have beneficial environmental effects.	我是中文句子
Specialization in each country allows people to obtain more of what they want, which, especially at higher income levels, includes cleaner air and water.	我是中文句子
When trade brings down costs, it can benefit environmental goods just as much as it benefits other goods.	我是中文句子
So, is trade globalization, on balance, better or worse for the environment?	我是中文句子
Some empirical studies of cross-country data find net beneficial effects on indicators of environmental degradation like local sulfur-dioxide air pollution.	我是中文句子
Provided that countries have effective governance institutions at the national level, trade and growth give them the means to clean their air.	我是中文句子
The solar-power industry is a perfect example of how trade can benefit air quality.	我是中文句子
The current embrace of protectionism threatens to reverse this progress.	我是中文句子
But “findings” of “dumping” into foreign markets surely warrant some response, no?	我是中文句子
Actually, no.	我是中文句子
But that is not even the way anti-dumping laws are usually written, let alone applied.	我是中文句子
Simply put, anti-dumping measures, such as the US and EU tariffs against Chinese solar panels, are a means of reducing, not fostering, competition.	我是中文句子
So, if predatory pricing is not the producers’ motive for selling below cost in these cases, what is?	我是中文句子
The solar-panel industry worldwide – in China, Europe, and the US – is experiencing a glut of productive capacity.	我是中文句子
As a result, global supply and demand are balanced at a market price that is below the long-term average cost per unit, which includes a share of the cost already incurred in building the factories.	我是中文句子
But that market price is not below the short-term cost of keeping the factories running once they are built.	我是中文句子
By this criterion, dumping occurs every time a store has a clearance sale.	我是中文句子
But a more revealing precedent is Japan’s VERs on exports of autos during this period.	我是中文句子
American automakers had found it increasingly difficult to compete against smaller, more fuel-efficient Japanese imports.	我是中文句子
When free trade was eventually restored, American wallets and air quality benefited (and the US auto industry was forced to become more efficient).	我是中文句子
Free trade in automobiles was good for the environment 30 years ago.	我是中文句子
The same is true of trade in solar equipment today.	我是中文句子
The Russian Godfather	我是中文句子
WARSAW – Russian President Vladimir Putin is behaving like a Mafia boss.	我是中文句子
In invading, occupying, and finally annexing Crimea, he pointed Russia’s guns at Ukraine and said: your territorial sovereignty or your life.	我是中文句子
So far, extortion has worked – and Putin knows it.	我是中文句子
Crimea is just the first step toward realizing his dream of revived Russian greatness.	我是中文句子
His address in the Kremlin was a tissue of lies and manipulation, though a subtle analysis would be a waste of time.	我是中文句子
The simple fact is that the president of one of the world’s most powerful countries has embarked on a path of confrontation with the entire international community.	我是中文句子
What is the point in displaying open contempt for Ukraine’s government, parliament, and people?	我是中文句子
Why label Ukrainian authorities “fascist and anti-Semitic”?	我是中文句子
In Putin’s mind, the whole world has discriminated against Russia for the last three centuries.	我是中文句子
Russia’s bloody despots – Catherine II, Nicholas I, or Stalin – apparently never discriminated against anyone.	我是中文句子
Putin also warns that “you and we – the Russians and the Ukrainians – could lose Crimea completely.”	我是中文句子
Yet he fails to specify who – perhaps Poles and Lithuanians again? – are setting their sights on Sevastopol.	我是中文句子
Russia could not, according to Putin, leave the people of Crimea “alone in their predicament.”	我是中文句子
“We want Ukraine to be a strong, sovereign, and independent country,” says Putin.	我是中文句子
Stalin said the same thing about Poland in 1945.	我是中文句子
This is the real end of history – the history of dreams about a world governed by democratic values and the market economy.	我是中文句子
It takes force to stop a thug, not sharp words or cosmetic sanctions.	我是中文句子
I commend and take pride in Poland’s prudent and determined policy and the attitude of its public, which do us great credit.	我是中文句子
But we must recognize that the best quarter-century in the last 400 years of Polish history is about to end before our very eyes.	我是中文句子
A time of tectonic shifts has begun.	我是中文句子
We must appreciate what we have managed to achieve – and learn to protect it.	我是中文句子
Mafia bosses often meet an unhappy fate, and I do not think that Putin will fare much better in the end.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, many people are likely to be hurt in the meantime, not least those who now support him.	我是中文句子
Living with Climate Change	我是中文句子
Across far-flung longitudes and latitudes, regions are struggling with the fallout from large-scale climate-related events.	我是中文句子
In California, firefighters are battling the embers of the largest wildfire in state history.	我是中文句子
Cooler weather has done little to ease the suffering.	我是中文句子
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “moderate” to “exceptional” drought conditions cover 25.1% of the United States.	我是中文句子
Regions in Australia also are struggling with the worst drought in a generation.	我是中文句子
The climate debate is no longer about causes; fossil fuels and human activity are the culprits.	我是中文句子
Rather, the question is how billions of at-risk people and businesses can rapidly adapt and ensure their communities are as resilient as possible.	我是中文句子
Some communities have already recognized this, and local adaptation is well under way.	我是中文句子
These are just two of the many infrastructural responses that communities around the world have undertaken.	我是中文句子
But adapting to climate change will also mean managing the long-term economic fallout of extreme weather, and this is a requirement that countries are only beginning to take seriously.	我是中文句子
Consider water scarcity.	我是中文句子
That would be painful anywhere, but it would be devastating in regions already rife with political turmoil and humanitarian crises.	我是中文句子
At the same time, rising sea levels will cause severe damage to coastal areas.	我是中文句子
The decline in property values will have far-reaching implications not only for individual wealth, but also for the tax bases of communities and the industries that serve them.	我是中文句子
No single international organization or authority has all the answers to the cascade of challenges that climate change has triggered.	我是中文句子
But some are taking key leadership roles and pushing governments and local communities to act with more urgency.	我是中文句子
Over the next 15 years, the world will need to invest some $90 trillion in infrastructure improvements.	我是中文句子
A Daughter of Dictatorship and Democracy	我是中文句子
Numerous opinion polls show Park Geun-hye of the ruling Grand National Party (GNP) to be the leading candidate.	我是中文句子
South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country’s leadership.	我是中文句子
Her political style is both refreshing and relevant, because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership.	我是中文句子
His daughter is proud of his legacy, which marked the beginning of South Korea’s economic boom.	我是中文句子
Indeed, as a pillar of export-oriented modernity, Park Chung-hee was once lionized as the archetype of a modernizing political leadership in military-authoritarian states.	我是中文句子
To many South Koreans, the election is now Park’s to lose.	我是中文句子
No candidate on the horizon seems able to stop her.	我是中文句子
If she wins, it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity, not her political heritage.	我是中文句子
No one in South Korea’s conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them.	我是中文句子
And, as an icon of the right, she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status.	我是中文句子
Despite her charisma, Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron.	我是中文句子
Her administration would mark a fresh departure from the country’s troubled recent past.	我是中文句子
Others take a flagrantly sexist stance, arguing that a woman president would be a non-starter as long as the North Korean regime continues to threaten national security.	我是中文句子
Although these criticisms don’t seem to bother the electorate very much, Park’s path to victory may yet prove narrower than her supporters expect.	我是中文句子
She has been called the “Queen of Elections,” in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man.	我是中文句子
Ms. Park once pledged to provide loans for working-class families from elementary school to college years, while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy.	我是中文句子
She favors engagement policy and the six-party talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles.	我是中文句子
Come presidential election-day in 2012, South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue.	我是中文句子
Park’s success will depend, in the end, on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines.	我是中文句子
Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori’s daughter, who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month, Park is likely to defy her family’s tragic history.	我是中文句子
If she does, she will be Asia’s most powerful woman, perhaps the most powerful in the world, at the end of next year.	我是中文句子
A Day for Planetary Justice	我是中文句子
On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice.	我是中文句子
October 24 is 350 Day.	我是中文句子
We are approaching a point of no return, at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet, no matter what we do.	我是中文句子
The melting of arctic ice is one example.	我是中文句子
Four hundred years ago, explorers sought the legendary “Northeast Passage” across the north of Europe and Russia to China.	我是中文句子
They found the arctic ice impenetrable, and soon gave up their quest.	我是中文句子
This year, commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage.	我是中文句子
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time.	我是中文句子
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger.	我是中文句子
Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is.	我是中文句子
In fact, the world’s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms, or more than double the permissible limit.	我是中文句子
But, while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit, Sri Lankan emissions were, at 660 kilograms, well below it.	我是中文句子
The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December.	我是中文句子
In some countries, including the United States, there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps.	我是中文句子
Churches will ring bells 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle towns, and, in many places, 350 trees will be planted.	我是中文句子
But don’t just sit back and hope that others will do enough to make an impact.	我是中文句子
One day your grandchildren will ask you: what did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time?	我是中文句子
A Day of Liberation	我是中文句子
One evening, I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past.	我是中文句子
From a child’s perspective, it wasn’t self-evident that losing was a good thing.	我是中文句子
But of course, my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation.	我是中文句子
In today’s Germany, an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation – not only for Europe, but also for Germany itself.	我是中文句子
Compared to public opinion in 1960, that’s certainly an enormous progress.	我是中文句子
To use my grandmother’s parlance, it is not “us” who were the liberators, but “them”.	我是中文句子
The way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself.	我是中文句子
A war of memories, in turn, may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future.	我是中文句子
Former perpetrators often try to de-legitimize their former victims’ moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves.	我是中文句子
Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed “Dresden’s Holocaust of bombs.”	我是中文句子
Fortunately, their propaganda campaign has been a failure.	我是中文句子
On the left side of the German political spectrum, the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged.	我是中文句子
However, it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result.	我是中文句子
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact.	我是中文句子
Its slogan “Never again war!” is only half the truth – the other half is “Never again appeasement!” 8 May 1945 was not “zero hour,” as a popular saying in Germany goes.	我是中文句子
There is yet another lesson to be learned.	我是中文句子
Yes, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively.	我是中文句子
But for millions of Central and East Europeans, liberation was followed by Stalin’s oppressive regime.	我是中文句子
But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem.	我是中文句子
On 8 May this year, public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget.	我是中文句子
They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned, history is bound to repeat itself.	我是中文句子
All this is perfectly true.	我是中文句子
But personally, I will also remember my grandmother’s sentence “Thank God we lost that war!”	我是中文句子
Thank God – and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe’s liberty.	我是中文句子
Crashing the SDR	我是中文句子
SANTA BARBARA – The Chinese government’s campaign to have its currency, the renminbi, included in the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset appears to be on the brink of success.	我是中文句子
Last week, IMF staff formally recommended adding the renminbi to the basket of currencies that determines the value of its so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).	我是中文句子
The addition of the renminbi to the basket, which currently includes the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen, would provide China with a boost to its prestige.	我是中文句子
More important, it would advance the government’s efforts to internationalize the renminbi.	我是中文句子
But it would also be a mistake.	我是中文句子
The decision to recommend the renminbi’s inclusion, far from having been made on sound economic grounds, can only be understood as political.	我是中文句子
As such, the long-term consequences are likely to be regrettable.	我是中文句子
On a purely technical basis, the renminbi’s qualifications for inclusion in the SDR basket are questionable.	我是中文句子
As the world’s largest exporter, China clearly meets the first condition.	我是中文句子
The second, however, is probably still beyond its reach.	我是中文句子
The renminbi is by no means in the same league as the SDR basket’s four incumbent currencies.	我是中文句子
In 2014, China’s currency ranked seventh in global central-bank reserves, eighth in international bond issuance, and 11th in global currency trading.	我是中文句子
So why did the IMF flip?	我是中文句子
The answer is obvious: China mounted a full-court press to change minds.	我是中文句子
In August, the currency’s exchange-rate regime was loosened slightly.	我是中文句子
Renminbi-denominated government bonds were issued in London, and plans were laid to create new trading platforms for the currency in several European financial centers.	我是中文句子
And Chinese policymakers made it abundantly clear how unhappy they would be with a negative decision.	我是中文句子
Their pressure paid off.	我是中文句子
One by one, Western governments fell in line behind the renminbi, despite its practical limitations.	我是中文句子
The Fund got the message, and now the fix is in.	我是中文句子
Many would argue that this is a positive development.	我是中文句子
Certainly, it mollifies China’s leaders, offering them a stronger incentive to continue to work within the existing international monetary regime.	我是中文句子
The decision to add the renminbi to the SDR basket may have put that danger into remission.	我是中文句子
On the other hand, the move sets a worrying precedent, injecting politics into a policy area that had been governed by objective economic considerations.	我是中文句子
Why not add the Swiss franc or the Canadian dollar?	我是中文句子
Or, for that matter, why not include the Russian ruble or Indian rupee?	我是中文句子
What was once the dignified preserve of obviously elite currencies could become the site of messy political battles for elevated status.	我是中文句子
Of course, it can be argued that China’s recent economic trajectory means that it is only a matter of time before the renminbi does become a match for the SDR’s incumbents.	我是中文句子
After all, international use of the currency has been growing exponentially.	我是中文句子
But that optimistic assessment overestimates the renminbi’s prospects and illustrates the danger of linear extrapolation of the past into the future.	我是中文句子
Likewise, use of the renminbi for the purpose of invoicing and settling trade with China is bound to continue growing.	我是中文句子
Nor is inclusion of the renminbi in the SDR basket likely to provide as big a boost to the currency’s internationalization as many believe.	我是中文句子
Some central banks may decide to follow suit, adding renminbi-denominated assets to their reserves to match the composition of the basket.	我是中文句子
But the increase will be marginal at best – some $40 billion in the next few years, according to the IMF’s calculations.	我是中文句子
With global reserves now totaling more than $10 trillion, that is a mere drop in the proverbial bucket.	我是中文句子
The political reasons for including the renminbi in the SDR are all too clear.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, the risks of doing so are no less obvious.	我是中文句子
A Defeat for International Tax Cooperation	我是中文句子
Developed countries blocked a proposal at the conference to establish an intergovernmental tax body within the United Nations to replace the current UN Committee of Experts.	我是中文句子
These countries insist that tax cooperation should take place exclusively under the leadership of the OECD, a body that they control.	我是中文句子
That is a profoundly disappointing outcome.	我是中文句子
The developed countries have an argument – but not a convincing one.	我是中文句子
The OECD, whose members are essentially the world’s 34 richest countries, certainly has the capacity to set international standards on taxation.	我是中文句子
Yet the domination of a select group of countries over tax norms has meant that, in reality, the global governance architecture for taxation has not kept pace with globalization.	我是中文句子
But although the OECD invites some developing countries to participate in its discussions to establish norms, it offers them no decision-making power.	我是中文句子
The OECD is thus a weak surrogate for a globally representative intergovernmental forum.	我是中文句子
Despite the disappointment in Addis Ababa, the call for reform of the international tax system is not likely to be silenced.	我是中文句子
The Making of Euro-Jihadism	我是中文句子
Divorce is not an option these days.	我是中文句子
But nor is the kind of marriage that the Islam scholar Tariq Ramadan advocates.	我是中文句子
Europe would then not just tolerate Islam, but actually embrace it as an integral part of itself.	我是中文句子
The problem with Ramadan’s vision is that Europe is an overwhelmingly secular continent, with a profoundly forward-thinking approach to ethics.	我是中文句子
Islamic societies, by contrast, are both deeply religious and deeply embedded in the past.	我是中文句子
Even Muslims who support the modernization of Islam would typically stop well short of Europe’s ethical vision.	我是中文句子
But it is the United States that launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, offers unconditional support to Israel, and has repeatedly propped up Arab autocrats.	我是中文句子
And it is Europe that has consistently criticized these policies – often harshly.	我是中文句子
Yet America is not being subjected to a major surge of jihadist sentiment within its borders.	我是中文句子
It might have helped that US President Barack Obama backed away from some of these policies.	我是中文句子
Europe has offered even more direct help to Arab countries in recent years.	我是中文句子
If it were not for Europe’s military intervention, Libyans would still be living under the tyrannical Muammar el-Qaddafi.	我是中文句子
True, Europe could have done more to prevent the ensuing chaos in Libya.	我是中文句子
But the people of Libya surely must take responsibility for the proliferation of competing militias that refuse to unite to save their state from total collapse.	我是中文句子
That is the result of a profound civilizational crisis – one that can be redressed only by the people of the Arab world.	我是中文句子
The real problem lies at home: a disastrous deficit of effective policies related to social justice, education, housing, and employment for young European Muslims.	我是中文句子
This link is apparent in the fact that the majority of European jihadists come from underprivileged backgrounds.	我是中文句子
Not particularly well versed in the true teachings of Islam, and lacking opportunities to improve their lives, they become easy prey for extremists.	我是中文句子
The story of America’s Muslims is the measure of Europe’s failure.	我是中文句子
Like most Americans, Muslims in the US maintain a certain amount of faith in the American dream.	我是中文句子
America is a country of immigrants, with a dynamic economy that has enabled newcomers, time and again, to achieve great success.	我是中文句子
Socially, America also offers something to Muslims that Europe does not.	我是中文句子
Its fundamentally religious culture enables Muslims to retain their identity to a far greater extent than in secular Europe.	我是中文句子
Indeed, America’s core values – personal responsibility and constitutional patriotism – can be easier for Muslims to swallow than Europe’s more aggressively secular brand of liberalism.	我是中文句子
As a result, integration and assimilation tend to be easier for Muslims in America.	我是中文句子
All of this suggests that Europe must look inward to address homegrown jihadism effectively.	我是中文句子
This does not mean that it should temper its secularism, much less its liberal values.	我是中文句子
Rather, Europe must breathe life into its own “European dream,” ensuring that all people have access to real opportunities to improve their lives.	我是中文句子
The New Climate Economics	我是中文句子
Last week, Mexico experienced simultaneous hurricanes in the Pacific and in the Gulf of Mexico that devastated towns and cities in their path.	我是中文句子
Climate change will be a major driver of such events, and we risk much worse.	我是中文句子
This puts a new debate center stage: how to reconcile increased action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with strong economic growth.	我是中文句子
It is a debate that is already mired in controversy.	我是中文句子
The advent of shale gas has confused the energy debate even more.	我是中文句子
If gas is substituted for coal, it can be a useful bridge to a low-carbon future.	我是中文句子
But astonishingly, it is coal, the dirtiest fuel, that is experiencing the sharpest increase in use.	我是中文句子
Policy vacillation in some countries has not helped.	我是中文句子
Advocates of stronger action respond that low-carbon investments can generate much stronger, cleaner growth.	我是中文句子
They point to the savings available from energy efficiency, and to the market opportunities generated by clean-energy technologies as the processes of learning and discovery take hold.	我是中文句子
That is regrettable.	我是中文句子
Climate change is not a partisan issue, and climate policy is essentially market-based.	我是中文句子
It is about correcting market failures so that markets and entrepreneurship can play their proper role of ensuring innovation and efficient resource allocation.	我是中文句子
Its purpose is to provide authoritative new evidence concerning how governments and businesses can achieve stronger economic growth while simultaneously addressing climate risks.	我是中文句子
Few governments or investors start from the standpoint of climate change.	我是中文句子
There is now a lot of experience around the world in this area.	我是中文句子
Now countries at all stages of development are pursuing new patterns of economic growth that take climate into account.	我是中文句子
Germany, for example, is planning the world’s most ambitious low-carbon energy transition, based on energy conservation and renewables.	我是中文句子
South Korea has made “green growth” a central economic goal.	我是中文句子
China has placed the industrial development of green technologies at the top of its agenda.	我是中文句子
Ethiopia is seeking to move to lower-carbon farming.	我是中文句子
Brazil has significantly reduced the rate of deforestation in the Amazon.	我是中文句子
Some major businesses are providing powerful examples of what is possible.	我是中文句子
Unilever has committed to the sustainable sourcing of agricultural and forest products.	我是中文句子
Coca-Cola is phasing out all use of climate-polluting hydrofluorocarbons.	我是中文句子
The retail giant Wal-Mart is driving emissions reduction throughout its supply chain.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank have stopped lending to high-emission coal plants.	我是中文句子
Yet genuine questions remain about how fast economies should move on to a low-carbon path, and the most effective way to do so.	我是中文句子
Some low-carbon policies have clearly been expensive, while other, apparently cost-effective options, have not been pursued at all.	我是中文句子
Any structural transformation involves costs, trade-offs, and uncertainties, and it is vital that we understand these properly.	我是中文句子
Powerful interests will, of course, oppose any low-carbon transition, dismissing and often drowning out those who stand to benefit.	我是中文句子
That makes it even more important to clarify the choices.	我是中文句子
As science makes clear how imperative the climate question is, it is time for economists and policymakers to explain how it can be answered.	我是中文句子
The Mouse Click that Roared	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – Until recently, cyber security has primarily interested computer geeks and cloak-and-dagger types.	我是中文句子
A “cyber attack” can take any number of forms, including simple probes, defacement of Web sites, denial-of-service attacks, espionage, and destruction of data.	我是中文句子
Cyber war and cyber espionage are largely associated with states, while cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors.	我是中文句子
Moreover, as alliances and tactics evolve, the categories may increasingly overlap.	我是中文句子
Terrorists might buy malware from criminals, and governments might find it useful to hide behind both.	我是中文句子
Some people argue that deterrence does not work in cyberspace, owing to the difficulties of attribution.	我是中文句子
But that is facile: inadequate attribution affects inter-state deterrence as well, yet it still operates.	我是中文句子
Even when the source of an attack can be successfully disguised under a “false flag,” governments may find themselves sufficiently enmeshed in symmetrically interdependent relationships such that a major attack would be counterproductive.	我是中文句子
China, for example, would lose from an attack that severely damaged the American economy, and vice versa.	我是中文句子
An unknown attacker may also be deterred by cyber-security measures.	我是中文句子
While accurate attribution of the ultimate source of a cyber attack is sometimes difficult, the determination does not have to be airtight.	我是中文句子
Finally, a reputation for offensive capability and a declared policy that keeps open the means of retaliation can help to reinforce deterrence.	我是中文句子
But, among states, even nuclear deterrence was more complex than it first looked, and that is doubly true of deterrence in the cyber domain.	我是中文句子
Given its global nature, the Internet requires a degree of international cooperation to be able to function.	我是中文句子
Some people call for the cyber equivalent of formal arms-control treaties.	我是中文句子
But differences in cultural norms and the difficulty of verification would make such treaties hard to negotiate or implement.	我是中文句子
At the same time, it is important to pursue international efforts to develop rules of the road that can limit conflict.	我是中文句子
The most promising areas for international cooperation today most likely concern problems posed for states by third parties such as criminals and terrorists.	我是中文句子
But the US has argued that arms-control measures banning offensive capabilities could weaken defenses against attacks and would be impossible to verify or enforce.	我是中文句子
Moreover, cultural differences impede any broad agreements on regulating online content.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, it may be possible to identify behaviors like cyber crime that are illegal in many domestic jurisdictions.	我是中文句子
Trying to limit all intrusions would be impossible, but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism involving non-state parties.	我是中文句子
Here, major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls.	我是中文句子
The transnational cyber domain poses new questions about the meaning of national security.	我是中文句子
Some of the most important responses must be national and unilateral, focused on hygiene, redundancy, and resilience.	我是中文句子
It is likely, however, that major governments will soon discover that the insecurity created by non-state cyber actors will require closer cooperation among governments.	我是中文句子
A Practical Agenda for Revolutionary Times	我是中文句子
Those who are supposed to represent them should not ignore this anger and frustration any longer.	我是中文句子
At the same time, the response from elites who regard themselves as the guardians of economic growth has sometimes made matters worse.	我是中文句子
What is new is that repeating these claims, without also addressing people’s deeper concerns, can now do more harm than good.	我是中文句子
Global public opinion has changed dramatically in recent years.	我是中文句子
A majority of people worldwide – and up to 72% of people in France and Italy – now believe that the system has failed them.	我是中文句子
These findings suggest that those defending free trade have lost credibility with the people they hope to persuade.	我是中文句子
Their vote is the only means they have left to hit back at the establishment.	我是中文句子
To address the public’s concerns requires a three-part agenda.	我是中文句子
The first order of business should be to reach out to those who feel voiceless and unrepresented.	我是中文句子
During the US presidential campaign, Donald Trump tapped into this sentiment when he vowed to punish any company that moves jobs to China or Mexico.	我是中文句子
The fact that it took a populist plutocrat to do it underscores the extent to which the American labor movement has been extinguished.	我是中文句子
Political parties that originally emerged from the labor movement have long since shifted to the “center.”	我是中文句子
Second, the quality of work, and the status that it confers, must be improved.	我是中文句子
In wealthy countries, precarious, poorly paid, and even dangerous forms of employment are becoming increasingly common.	我是中文句子
In 2010, these workers suffered work injuries at a 50% higher rate than unionized auto-parts workers elsewhere.	我是中文句子
As the OECD has shown, “non-standard” work is proliferating globally.	我是中文句子
This trend is contributing to deteriorating working conditions, making workers feel increasingly helpless and vulnerable.	我是中文句子
Reversing it will require robust standards to ensure workplace safety, fair pay, and the right to enter into collective-bargaining arrangements.	我是中文句子
Governments will have to intervene to set these standards, as they did during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to improve abysmal conditions in factories.	我是中文句子
Otherwise, businesses will not be able to behave decently, for fear of being undercut by unscrupulous competitors.	我是中文句子
Finally, more opportunities must be created for the next generation – and not just economic opportunities.	我是中文句子
Since the 2008 financial crisis, many governments have reduced their investments in health, education, housing, and other forms of human capital.	我是中文句子
Many have also cut support for the unemployed, homeless, or indebted.	我是中文句子
As a result, those who have fallen behind are deprived not just of resources, but, more important, the chance to pursue their aspirations.	我是中文句子
As the IMF, World Bank, and WTO show in their report, free trade and globalization have certainly increased the size of the overall economic pie.	我是中文句子
In theory, this should have expanded governments’ capacity to compensate those left behind and create the conditions for them to get ahead.	我是中文句子
In fact, the opposite has happened, owing to government cutbacks since 2008.	我是中文句子
The establishment’s agenda has been failing for too long.	我是中文句子
And as elites continue to proclaim the benefits of free trade and globalization, they are merely widening the chasm of popular mistrust.	我是中文句子
Over the past year, that mistrust has boiled over in many countries, with voters in one election after another rejecting the status quo.	我是中文句子
Piecemeal curbs on globalization will not be enough to quell the revolt.	我是中文句子
The Development Costs of Homophobia	我是中文句子
LONDON – As a gay man living in Nigeria, my biggest challenge was choosing between my sexuality and my job.	我是中文句子
In 2004, I was at the start of my acting career.	我是中文句子
Whispers were making the rounds about my private life, and I decided it was time to come out.	我是中文句子
So I agreed to go on Nigeria’s most-watched television talk show to discuss my sexuality.	我是中文句子
Almost immediately, my character was eliminated.	我是中文句子
And when my job disappeared, so did my financial security.	我是中文句子
Like many gay men and lesbians in Africa, my choice was between economic freedom and mental imprisonment.	我是中文句子
This year, Nigeria and Uganda put in place draconian anti-gay laws, sparking a worldwide debate about human rights.	我是中文句子
This debate has also started at the World Bank, whose president, Jim Yong Kim, recently declared that “institutionalized discrimination is bad for people and for societies.”	我是中文句子
Kim’s statement has invited criticism and controversy.	我是中文句子
But this assumes that homosexuality is “un-African.”	我是中文句子
Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni followed suit when signing the anti-gay bill into law in 2014.	我是中文句子
These official attitudes have caused significant suffering for Africa’s gays and lesbians.	我是中文句子
But here is what Africa’s anti-gay leaders miss: legal protections are not only a human-rights issue, but also an economic issue.	我是中文句子
In addition to such concrete costs, being gay can bring violence, job loss, family rejection, harassment in schools, and pressure to marry.	我是中文句子
As a result, many gay people have less education, lower productivity, lower earnings, poorer health, and a shorter life expectancy.	我是中文句子
During our first year, we provided support for dozens of people.	我是中文句子
Another, “Uche,” was fired from his job as a chef after his sexuality was revealed.	我是中文句子
TIERs helped him with accommodation and capital to set up a catering business.	我是中文句子
Though almost 10 years have passed, it is still not safe to use their real names.	我是中文句子
The World Bank, always wary of entangling itself in “political” questions, emphasizes that it is not a global human-rights enforcer.	我是中文句子
But it also increasingly recognizes its own role as a facilitator in helping Bank members realize their human-rights obligations.	我是中文句子
LGBT rights should be a test case.	我是中文句子
Aid to governments that permit specific social groups to be ostracized can carry very real economic costs.	我是中文句子
As new loans are considered, steps should be taken to ensure that the benefits are as inclusive as possible.	我是中文句子
Africa’s LGBT people desperately need such powerful allies in their struggle for human and economic rights.	我是中文句子
A Democratic Burma?	我是中文句子
TOKYO – Historic transformations often happen when least expected.	我是中文句子
Deng Xiaoping’s economic opening followed China’s bloody – and failed – invasion of Vietnam in 1978.	我是中文句子
Is Burma, like South Africa under de Klerk, truly poised to emerge from a half-century of self-imposed isolation?	我是中文句子
Despite her two decades of house arrest and isolation, Suu Kyi possesses two of the gifts that enabled Mandela to carry out his great task: a reassuring serenity and an utter lack of vindictiveness.	我是中文句子
Moreover, unlike Mandela during his 27-year imprisonment, Suu Kyi has had her hopes raised – and dashed – before.	我是中文句子
On both occasions, however, the regime’s hardliners gained the upper hand, crushing prospects for reform.	我是中文句子
Yet Suu Kyi, and much of the Burmese opposition, is beginning to admit that today’s political liberalization might be the real thing.	我是中文句子
Thein Sein’s decision to halt the project is clearly an important policy shift.	我是中文句子
If Suu Kyi is permitted to campaign free of restraint, for both her own seat and to boost the electoral chances of her NLD colleagues, it will be clear that Thein Sein and his government are truly determined to bring their country in from the cold.	我是中文句子
But the international community, too, must act with great care.	我是中文句子
While Thein Sein would undoubtedly wish to see the myriad economic and political sanctions imposed on Burma quickly lifted, it is too soon for a general easing of such measures.	我是中文句子
But the outside world should demonstrate that every clear move toward greater political openness will merit more international political and economic engagement.	我是中文句子
No one should rush to judgment yet, but Thein Sein’s decisions, at least so far, are beginning to resemble those of South Africa’s de Klerk when he initiated his country’s reform process.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, Burma already has in Aung San Suu Kyi its very own Nelson Mandela.	我是中文句子
A Devaluation Option for Southern Europe	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – This year is likely to mark a make-or-break ordeal for the euro.	我是中文句子
The crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone.	我是中文句子
Does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone?	我是中文句子
There is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require southern Europe’s troubled economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates.	我是中文句子
It involves increasing the value-added tax while cutting payroll taxes.	我是中文句子
An increase in VAT raises the price of imported goods, as foreign firms face a higher tax.	我是中文句子
To ensure that domestic firms do not have an incentive to raise prices, an increase in VAT needs to be accompanied by a cut in payroll taxes.	我是中文句子
Moreover, since exports are exempt from VAT, the price of domestic exports will fall.	我是中文句子
The desired competitiveness effects of exchange-rate devaluation can thus be had while staying in the euro.	我是中文句子
This policy can also help on the fiscal front.	我是中文句子
As is true of an exchange-rate devaluation, the positive impact on growth of an increase in competitiveness can strengthen the fiscal position by raising tax revenues.	我是中文句子
Moreover, an important advantage of fiscal devaluations is that they generate additional revenues in proportion to the country’s trade deficit.	我是中文句子
Like exchange-rate devaluations, fiscal devaluations create winners and losers.	我是中文句子
If taxes on capital are not adjusted, holders of domestic stocks suffer a comparable loss.	我是中文句子
The same is true of minimum wages.	我是中文句子
Fiscal devaluations already have some advocates.	我是中文句子
Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government just announced one.	我是中文句子
In short, there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchange-rate devaluation that can address southern Europe’s short-term competitiveness problems.	我是中文句子
To be sure, feasible fiscal devaluations would be limited in size.	我是中文句子
A Dissident in China	我是中文句子
TOKYO – 2009 was a good year for China. The Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession.	我是中文句子
The Chinese government, under the Communist Party, has every reason to feel confident.	我是中文句子
Liu is not a violent rebel. His opinions, in articles published on the Internet, are entirely peaceful.	我是中文句子
Yet he was jailed for “inciting subversion of state power.”	我是中文句子
The notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd.	我是中文句子
And yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him, to prevent others from expressing similar views.	我是中文句子
Why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions, or even peaceful petitions, so dangerous?	我是中文句子
Perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks.	我是中文句子
Without legitimacy, no government can rule with any sense of confidence. There are many ways to legitimize political arrangements.	我是中文句子
Instead, the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief, imposed from above, in ideological orthodoxy.	我是中文句子
In imperial China, this meant Confucian orthodoxy.	我是中文句子
The ideal of the Confucian state is “harmony.”	我是中文句子
If all people conform to a particular set of beliefs, including moral codes of behavior, conflicts will disappear.	我是中文句子
The ruled, in this ideal system, will naturally obey their rulers, just as sons obey their fathers.	我是中文句子
After the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century, Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism.	我是中文句子
Chairman Mao’s rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism.	我是中文句子
This orthodoxy, however, was also destined to fade away.	我是中文句子
Few Chinese, even in the top ranks of the Communist Party, are convinced Marxists anymore.	我是中文句子
This left an ideological vacuum, swiftly filled in the 1980’s by greed, cynicism, and corruption.	我是中文句子
Out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China, collectively known as “Tiananmen.”	我是中文句子
Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in 1989 for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom.	我是中文句子
Soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen, a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism: Chinese nationalism.	我是中文句子
Only one-party rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation.	我是中文句子
The Communist Party represented China’s destiny as a great power. To doubt this was not just mistaken, but unpatriotic, even “anti-Chinese.”	我是中文句子
From this perspective, Liu Xiaobo’s critical views were indeed subversive.	我是中文句子
They cast doubt on the official orthodoxy, and thus on the legitimacy of the state.	我是中文句子
But the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics.	我是中文句子
These things can change.	我是中文句子
But external pressure is unlikely to bring it about.	我是中文句子
Many non-Chinese, including me, have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo.	我是中文句子
Until China is released from the grip of religious politics, Liu’s ideals are unlikely to take root.	我是中文句子
This does not bode well for China, or, indeed, for the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
A Drug War on Auto-Pilot	我是中文句子
Ciudad Juárez, a sprawling Mexican border town that is now the homicide capital of the world, would have to be high on the list.	我是中文句子
Four bridges and innumerable tunnels and drainage canals connect Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, Texas.	我是中文句子
Rival cartels sparring for control of a plaza, the name given to any trafficking route, butcher each other and the security forces.	我是中文句子
There is apparently no shortage of young, unemployed men willing to join the carnage.	我是中文句子
But the language used by the Obama administration to describe the violence and state corruption that snakes from the Andes to the US border is starting to capture new thinking on narcotics.	我是中文句子
More strikingly, both Bolivia and Ecuador are governed by presidents who suffered directly from the collateral insensitivities of the war on drugs.	我是中文句子
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa’s father was jailed for smuggling drugs to the US when the future leader was five years old.	我是中文句子
Prohibition hikes the mark-up on prices – an astounding 15,000% in the case of cocaine traveling to Europe from Andean processing facilities.	我是中文句子
How do you control it?	我是中文句子
The capos can be jailed, killed, or extradited, but their replacements are already wandering around.”	我是中文句子
The emergence of Latin America’s powerful drug mafias cannot be traced to the radical evil of certain individuals.	我是中文句子
These people emerged under conditions created in deeply inequitable societies by a misapplied, inconsistent, and bureaucratic war.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, in Jamaica and across the rural outposts of Central America, drug lords have become benefactors and heroes to the poor.	我是中文句子
For now, policymakers across the Americas are tiptoeing towards the obvious.	我是中文句子
A Global "New Deal"?	我是中文句子
Conventional theory suggests that a single country (or group of countries) consolidating its finances can expect lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and an improved trade position.	我是中文句子
Indeed, it was this dynamic – against which John Maynard Keynes fought – that made the Great Depression of the 1930’s so grim.	我是中文句子
Today’s problems are compounded by a lack of sufficient private demand – particularly household consumption – in the advanced economies to compensate for demand losses stemming from austerity.	我是中文句子
During the last two decades, consumption drove these countries’ economic growth, reaching historically high GDP shares.	我是中文句子
Recent moves to ease monetary policy have been a step in the right direction; but, so far, they have not proved to be a game changer.	我是中文句子
For domestic demand to act as an engine of growth, policies should shift resources from investment to consumption.	我是中文句子
While the magnitudes involved are huge, they must be attained if an extended period of low growth, high unemployment, and declining living standards among the world’s poorest is to be avoided.	我是中文句子
International economic policy coordination should be significantly strengthened in order to deal effectively with changes on such a scale.	我是中文句子
Start with Europe.	我是中文句子
It is by now patently obvious that austerity and domestic reforms are not enough to pull the eurozone’s periphery out of deep recession.	我是中文句子
Returning the eurozone’s peripheral economies to the path of growth requires more than structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.	我是中文句子
This is a tall order, in view of the reluctance of most EU member states to cede competences to European institutions.	我是中文句子
But Europe should move more decisively in this direction.	我是中文句子
On a global scale, neither the US nor Japan is in a position to provide significant external stimulus.	我是中文句子
In other words, a global “New Deal” – combining policies designed to achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide – seems to be required.	我是中文句子
The advanced economies should promote productivity-enhancing structural reforms with renewed vigor.	我是中文句子
The eurozone should solidify its currency union.	我是中文句子
And the emerging and developing economies should support domestic sources of growth.	我是中文句子
For such a deal to become possible, certain preconditions must be met.	我是中文句子
The secretariat should actively cooperate with the IMF to benefit from its analysis, notably regarding exchange rates.	我是中文句子
Second, global financial reform must proceed at a faster pace.	我是中文句子
This is critically important for inspiring confidence in Asian countries, which might be persuaded to favor domestic, as opposed to external, sources of demand.	我是中文句子
Moreover, trade liberalization will also increase consumer confidence worldwide.	我是中文句子
The Other Financial Crisis	我是中文句子
The sovereign-debt crisis is well known.	我是中文句子
In order to avert a likely depression, governments around the world engaged in fiscal and monetary stimulus in the midst of the global financial crisis.	我是中文句子
While sovereign credit quality has deteriorated virtually across the board, and will most probably continue to do so, the implications for individual countries vary.	我是中文句子
There they remain, still failing to provide citizens with a light at the end of what already has been a long tunnel.	我是中文句子
It is not surprising that policy approaches have also varied.	我是中文句子
Greece essentially defaulted on some obligations.	我是中文句子
Ireland opted for austerity and reforms, as has the United Kingdom.	我是中文句子
The US is gradually transferring resources from creditors to debtors through financial repression.	我是中文句子
And Germany is slowly acquiescing to a prudent relative expansion in domestic demand.	我是中文句子
After all, sovereigns are called that because they have the power to impose taxes, regulations, and, at the extreme, confiscation.	我是中文句子
The immediate causes are well known.	我是中文句子
Indeed, unemployment data in many advanced countries are dominated by long-term joblessness (usually defined as six months or more).	我是中文句子
Governments are doing too little to address the private credit debacle.	我是中文句子
Arguably, they must first sort out the sovereign side of the crisis; but it is not clear that most officials even have a comprehensive plan.	我是中文句子
Policy asymmetry is greatest for the countries most acutely affected by the sovereign-debt crisis.	我是中文句子
The European Central Bank is taking a similarly indirect approach.	我是中文句子
In both places, other policymaking entities, with much better tools at their disposal, appear either unwilling or unable to play their part.	我是中文句子
As such, action by central banks will repeatedly fail to gain sufficient traction.	我是中文句子
In fact, only the UK is visibly opting for a more coordinated and direct way to counter the persistent shortfalls stemming from the private part of the credit crisis.	我是中文句子
The UK example is important; but, given the scope and scale of the challenges, the proposal is a relatively modest one.	我是中文句子
Proper access to credit for productive segments is an integral part of a well-functioning economy.	我是中文句子
Without it, growth falters, job creation is insufficient, and widening income and wealth inequality undermines the social fabric.	我是中文句子
That is why any comprehensive approach to restoring the advanced countries’ economic and financial vibrancy must target the proper revival of private credit flows.	我是中文句子
Toxic Politics Versus Better Economics	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The relationship between politics and economics is changing.	我是中文句子
This trend must be reversed, before it structurally cripples the advanced world and sweeps up the emerging economies, too.	我是中文句子
Obviously, political infighting is nothing new.	我是中文句子
The embrace of the Washington Consensus by multilateral institutions amplified its transmission, helping to drive forward the broader process of economic and financial globalization.	我是中文句子
But after years of unusually sluggish and strikingly non-inclusive growth, the consensus is breaking down.	我是中文句子
Anti-establishment movements and figures have been quick to seize on this frustration, using inflammatory and even combative rhetoric to win support.	我是中文句子
They do not even have to win elections to disrupt the transmission mechanism between economics and politics.	我是中文句子
The referendum happened for one reason: in 2013, then-Prime Minister David Cameron feared that he would be unable to secure sufficiently his Conservative Party base in the general election that year.	我是中文句子
So he pandered to Euroskeptic voters with the promise of a referendum.	我是中文句子
The source of Cameron’s fear?	我是中文句子
Now, it seems, the floodgates have opened.	我是中文句子
Several other advanced economies are experiencing analogous political developments.	我是中文句子
Make no mistake: solid and credible policy options are available.	我是中文句子
After years of mediocre economic performance, there is widespread agreement that a shift away from excessive dependence on unconventional monetary policy is needed.	我是中文句子
As IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde put it, “central banks cannot be the only game in town.”	我是中文句子
And yet they have been.	我是中文句子
The emergence of a new consensus on these points is good news.	我是中文句子
But, in the current political environment, translating that consensus into action is likely to happen too slowly, at best.	我是中文句子
The risk is that, as bad politics crowds out good economics, popular anger and frustration will rise, making politics even more toxic.	我是中文句子
Another Lesson from Japan	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – Yet another in a long string of negative inflation surprises is at hand.	我是中文句子
Over the three months ending in May, the core CPI was basically unchanged, holding, at just 1.7% above its year-earlier level.	我是中文句子
Halfway around the world, a similar story continues to play out in Japan.	我是中文句子
But, for the deflation-prone Japanese economy, it’s a much tougher story.	我是中文句子
Through April, Japan’s core CPI was basically flat relative to its year-earlier level, with a similar outcome evident in May for the Tokyo metropolitan area.	我是中文句子
This story is global in scope.	我是中文句子
But they are exceptions in an otherwise inflationless world.	我是中文句子
The International Monetary Fund’s latest forecasts bear this out.	我是中文句子
Notwithstanding a modest firming of global economic growth, inflation in the advanced economies is expected to average slightly less than 2% in 2017-2018.	我是中文句子
The first chapter of this tale was written many years ago, in Japan.	我是中文句子
But no lesson is more profound than that of a series of policy blunders made by the BoJ.	我是中文句子
This has created an unhealthy dependency from which there is no easy exit.	我是中文句子
Though Japan’s experience since the early 1990s provides many lessons, the rest of the world has failed miserably at heeding them.	我是中文句子
The inflation surprise of 2017 offers three key insights.	我是中文句子
Second, today’s globalization is inherently asymmetric.	我是中文句子
Juxtaposed against a backdrop of ever-expanding supply, the resulting imbalance is inherently deflationary.	我是中文句子
Third, central banks are all but powerless to cope with the moving target of what can be called a non-stationary liquidity trap.	我是中文句子
Sound familiar?	我是中文句子
The novel twist today is the ever-expanding global supply curve.	我是中文句子
That makes today’s central banks even more impotent than they were in the 1930s.	我是中文句子
This is not an incurable disease.	我是中文句子
The most important lesson from the 1930s, as well as from the modern-day Japanese experience, is that monetary policy provides no answer for a chronic deficiency of aggregate demand.	我是中文句子
Addressing it is a task primarily for fiscal authorities. The idea that central banks should consider making a new promise to raise their inflation targets is hardly credible.	我是中文句子
We ignore history at great peril.	我是中文句子
The latest disappointment for inflation-targeting central banks is really not a surprise after all. The same is true of the related drop in long-term interest rates.	我是中文句子
There is much to be gained by studying carefully the lessons of Japan.	我是中文句子
A Rest Stop for Europe	我是中文句子
He pointed out that, in addition to the economic crisis, there is “a crisis of confidence in Europe as a political project.”	我是中文句子
While Gauck made clear that he remains decidedly pro-Europe, he highlighted the need for closer reflection about Europe’s future – and especially that of the eurozone.	我是中文句子
Standing on the verge of greater integration, Europeans are hesitant, “unsure whether we should really stride out on the onward journey.”	我是中文句子
Addressing this hesitation, he declared, will require a thoughtful, nuanced understanding of what “more Europe” actually means.	我是中文句子
Gauck may not have gone far enough: At this point, an ever-closer union may be a political mirage.	我是中文句子
Repeatedly pretending to move forward, then pulling back at the critical point, exacerbates political uncertainty and economic vulnerability.	我是中文句子
Rather than indecisively pursuing more unity, this may be the moment to restore effective sovereignty to national authorities in eurozone countries.	我是中文句子
Such a move would alleviate anxiety in the short term, thereby giving Europeans the opportunity to regroup in preparation for future steps toward a more integrated Europe and a more resilient euro.	我是中文句子
To this end, eurozone leaders must take three key steps.	我是中文句子
The case against European fiscal governance is straightforward.	我是中文句子
Before the crisis, the single-minded emphasis on reducing national budget deficits to less than 3% of GDP led to extensive abuse.	我是中文句子
And the belief in economic growth as a fiscal panacea led to unrealistically optimistic GDP forecasts.	我是中文句子
In other words, EU leaders began to complicate fiscal governance, ultimately creating an inefficient, inescapable labyrinth of regulation and bureaucracy.	我是中文句子
As fiscal metrics become increasingly intricate, monitoring efforts will become ever easier to undermine.	我是中文句子
The case for returning fiscal responsibility to national authorities is also strong – and not only because centralized fiscal authority has proved to be so inefficient.	我是中文句子
With citizens of distressed countries bearing the fiscal burden of the crisis, the enduring presumption that they will not act responsibly is patronizing, at best.	我是中文句子
And the current strategy of exchanging goodies for good behavior encourages game-playing and dilutes responsibility.	我是中文句子
While the risk that governments will succumb to fiscal temptation remains, citizens’ current suffering is likely to deter future excesses.	我是中文句子
National fiscal sovereignty would facilitate the final crucial step: building a more mature relationship with private lenders.	我是中文句子
The eurozone was founded on the “no bailout” principle: if member states could not repay their debts, lenders would bear the losses.	我是中文句子
But lenders chose – correctly, as it turned out – to disregard that threat.	我是中文句子
Instead of enforcing the no-bailout principle and establishing a precedent, debtor countries used official loans to repay private creditors.	我是中文句子
Only by shifting the burden of responsibility back onto private lenders can debtor countries escape this quagmire.	我是中文句子
In the United States, each state is responsible for its fiscal management, without being forced to comply with a single, overarching template.	我是中文句子
The states are not regulated by the federal government; they are disciplined by the knowledge that no one will repay their debts for them.	我是中文句子
And the system seems to work: entering the crisis, US states had significantly lower deficit and debt ratios than the eurozone’s vulnerable member states.	我是中文句子
Europeans should have the chance to regain their footing.	我是中文句子
In short, taking a step back would provide an opportunity to reset, to reflect, and to plot the best course toward a more stable, more integrated Europe.	我是中文句子
For a fiscal union to function – however unlikely that outcome may be – a solid foundation is crucial.	我是中文句子
Giving Europeans the time and space to choose more Europe would reinforce the core values upon which integration has rested for more than six decades.	我是中文句子
Continuing to stumble forward, however, would inevitably lead to a debilitating, if not fatal, fall.	我是中文句子
A European Cure for Balkan Depression	我是中文句子
VIENNA – European politics is mostly shaped by events and anniversaries.	我是中文句子
But while events are often unforeseeable, anniversaries are not.	我是中文句子
World leaders may have already reserved some days in August 2014 to mark the occasion.	我是中文句子
It is easy to predict that Sarajevo will be the place where they will meet to look back on Europe’s savage twentieth century.	我是中文句子
But how will Sarajevo look in five years?	我是中文句子
Will it still be the capital of a country whose citizens view the future bleakly and whose politicians have totally lost touch with the electorate?	我是中文句子
The findings seem to indicate that the next five years will be a make-or-break period for the region’s future development.	我是中文句子
The future promises peace without development.	我是中文句子
Trust in political elites and in national and European institutions has been steadily declining.	我是中文句子
The majority of citizens have experienced a decline in living standards in the last year, and there remains a perception that people have more opportunities outside their own countries.	我是中文句子
Pessimism about employment is alarmingly high among young people, while corruption and government mismanagement are regarded as being widespread.	我是中文句子
All those who have made it their job to praise the stability in the region should look at these figures.	我是中文句子
Indeed, it is striking that the majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their leaders are not interested in their country joining the EU.	我是中文句子
An absolute majority of citizens in each of the surveyed countries are convinced that their country is heading in the wrong direction.	我是中文句子
Less than one in 10 Croats (whose country could be joining the EU in the near future) believes that their country is heading in the right direction.	我是中文句子
Stability alone can no longer be the EU’s only objective in the region.	我是中文句子
If European leaders do plan to meet in 2014 in Sarajevo, they should act now.	我是中文句子
But it is now or never for the Balkans.	我是中文句子
In short, the moment has arrived for shaping events instead of simply marking anniversaries.	我是中文句子
Closing Europe’s Strategy Gap	我是中文句子
MADRID – The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hot topic of analysis for almost a year.	我是中文句子
But one question has largely escaped thorough examination: what Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine indicates about the European Union’s foreign policy.	我是中文句子
During the early stages of the crisis, Germany, which had bet heavily on Russia’s modernization, was averse to taking any consequential action.	我是中文句子
But, as the crisis deepened, German Chancellor Angela Merkel worked to persuade her European counterparts to implement a broad and biting sanctions regime.	我是中文句子
On both of these fronts, the EU’s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that Europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.	我是中文句子
It increasingly appears that Ukraine is becoming locked in a “frozen conflict” – Russia’s foreign-policy specialty.	我是中文句子
EU leaders should take advantage of the break in the fighting to stop reacting and start anticipating.	我是中文句子
With a long-term strategic vision, the EU could overwhelm and ultimately undermine Putin’s short-term successes.	我是中文句子
Such a vision must include a reconceptualization of the ENP.	我是中文句子
In other words, the ENP does not account for the developmental, cultural, and aspirational differences among the EU’s partner countries.	我是中文句子
The ENP suffers operationally from its excessively technical approach and lack of strategic vision.	我是中文句子
It is telling that Ashton has made progress exclusively in areas defined by ample consensus, such as the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia.	我是中文句子
Further eroding Europe’s effectiveness is its fragmented approach to securing energy supplies.	我是中文句子
With every country largely controlling its own energy policy, Europe’s energy market has become inefficient and excessively dependent on Russian supplies.	我是中文句子
To the extent that there has been an EU-wide energy strategy, it has related to renewables, rather than the intersection of geopolitics and energy security.	我是中文句子
But there is reason for hope.	我是中文句子
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a reset of Europe’s foreign-policy strategy.	我是中文句子
And, most important, all EU member states must recommit themselves to cooperation.	我是中文句子
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of Europe’s values.	我是中文句子
Indeed, Europe has a large set of tools at its disposal; it just needs to figure out how to use them.	我是中文句子
If it can, it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge, but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today’s rapidly shifting global environment.	我是中文句子
A Europe of Women?	我是中文句子
PARIS – Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming an engine for political change?	我是中文句子
In economic-development circles, experience and common sense suggest that progress, accountability, and hard work start with and depend on women.	我是中文句子
Micro-credits, for example, are much more efficient when women receive and repay them.	我是中文句子
Perhaps because they bear children and must find the means to feed them, women are now perceived as the best and most determined “agents of change.”	我是中文句子
That seems to be as true now of European politics as it has been of economics in parts of Africa and Asia.	我是中文句子
When Berlusconi first came to power 17 years ago, he had the support of a majority of women.	我是中文句子
Italian men may pity the aging, isolated leader, who looks increasingly like his wax effigy at Madame Tussaud’s.	我是中文句子
Women, of course, are not alone in their opposition to Berlusconi, but they made the difference in Milan.	我是中文句子
They are the incarnation of modernity, animated by a yearning for simple dignity and respect.	我是中文句子
They are not alone in the vanguard of a new Europe of women.	我是中文句子
So they elected one as President.	我是中文句子
The depth and gravity of the current economic and social crisis in countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain present women with a new opportunity.	我是中文句子
Confronted with what many of them perceive as the equivalent of an “economic war,” women are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining their families’ financial security.	我是中文句子
And the more widespread this becomes, the more women will seek a political role that reflects their economic clout.	我是中文句子
Of course, women’s changing status may not translate immediately into growing political influence.	我是中文句子
But such a dynamic does now seem to be in motion.	我是中文句子
Similarly, regardless of the outcome of DSK’s trial in New York, the case might represent a turning point in the treatment of women in Europe.	我是中文句子
Public and private displays of atavistic machismo, one hopes, will no longer be considered acceptable.	我是中文句子
In the Arab world, too, from Tunis to Cairo, young women have played an important role in the revolutionary process.	我是中文句子
None of this is to argue that “women” are a universal force for positive change in Europe and around the world.	我是中文句子
A Euro Sabbatical	我是中文句子
Salaries are being slashed and public employees sacked to reduce new borrowing to a tolerable level.	我是中文句子
And yet, competitiveness in Greece and Portugal, in particular, is not improving.	我是中文句子
A reduction in unit labor costs can also increase competitiveness only to the extent that it actually results in price reductions.	我是中文句子
Now that capital markets are no longer willing to finance these deficits, prices should be going into reverse, but this, obviously, is not happening.	我是中文句子
In 2010, inflation in some of the crisis countries lagged slightly behind that of their eurozone competitors.	我是中文句子
On the whole, Ireland has become cheaper relative to its eurozone competitors by a total of 15% over the course of the past five years.	我是中文句子
However, Ireland’s big trade surplus did improve further.	我是中文句子
Greece, on the other hand, is under the influence of a strong import lobby.	我是中文句子
The situation is intractable.	我是中文句子
Many people regard debt relief and socialization of debts as the only way out.	我是中文句子
This help has been given.	我是中文句子
The debts will re-emerge like a tumor, growing year by year, while undermining the creditworthiness of stable eurozone countries.	我是中文句子
If that happened, the euro would eventually collapse.	我是中文句子
Only a price reduction would create current-account surpluses and enable the crisis countries to pay off their foreign debts.	我是中文句子
It is time for Europe to come to terms with this remorseless truth.	我是中文句子
Those crisis countries that do not want to take it upon themselves to lower their prices should be given the opportunity to leave the eurozone temporarily in order to devalue prices and debts.	我是中文句子
After the ensuing financial thunderstorm died down, the sun would come out again very quickly.	我是中文句子
A Fair Deal for Turkey	我是中文句子
The Commission’s progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month.	我是中文句子
At that meeting, European leaders should ask themselves the following questions: Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus?	我是中文句子
Has the EU’s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey?	我是中文句子
What are the EU’s long-term interests vis-à-vis Turkey?	我是中文句子
If the answers to the first two questions are “no” – as I believe they are – the third question becomes vitally important.	我是中文句子
True, Turkey has closed its ports to ships from (Greek) Cyprus, and this is a violation of agreements.	我是中文句子
But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership.	我是中文句子
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island.	我是中文句子
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004.	我是中文句子
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part.	我是中文句子
But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it.	我是中文句子
Nevertheless, Cyprus became an EU member – but only the Greek part.	我是中文句子
This was clearly a mistake, because it made the EU part of the conflict.	我是中文句子
It gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey.	我是中文句子
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU’s fairness?	我是中文句子
Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching, for they have clearly been spurred by Turks’ wish to move closer to the EU.	我是中文句子
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal.	我是中文句子
Therefore, the recent lack of progress in Turkey’s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU’s behavior.	我是中文句子
This leaves us with the third question: what kind of Turkey does the EU want?	我是中文句子
There should be no doubt about the answer: it is clearly in the EU’s interest to see Turkey’s democracy and economy continue to strengthen.	我是中文句子
More than 40 years ago, it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership, it will be welcome in the EU.	我是中文句子
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously.	我是中文句子
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership.	我是中文句子
But they are reacting to the current situation.	我是中文句子
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges.	我是中文句子
Second, they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations.	我是中文句子
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors.	我是中文句子
Here the Finns, who chair the EU right now, have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict.	我是中文句子
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders.	我是中文句子
At the same time, a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN’s proposals regarding Cyprus.	我是中文句子
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU’s own ranks, so be it.	我是中文句子
A Farewell to (Glorious) War	我是中文句子
Nor could Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon.	我是中文句子
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II.	我是中文句子
So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetric entity, Hezbollah, with nation-state firepower.	我是中文句子
So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point.	我是中文句子
When geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, mass no longer equals victory.	我是中文句子
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate, and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war.	我是中文句子
In fact, the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble.	我是中文句子
Moreover, in an era of global media and international war crimes courts, the criteria for states’ use of military force have become more complex than ever.	我是中文句子
Inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found, such as Israel’s border with Syria, India’s border with Pakistan, and the border dividing the two Koreas.	我是中文句子
In such cases, war, as the Egyptians showed in 1973, might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict.	我是中文句子
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights.	我是中文句子
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete.	我是中文句子
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing.	我是中文句子
“Victory” cannot bring peace, simply because there will always be a war after the war.	我是中文句子
Thus, for example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months, only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict.	我是中文句子
And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as it was before.	我是中文句子
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched.	我是中文句子
The Iraq war and Israel’s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve, as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution.	我是中文句子
When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts, forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity.	我是中文句子
That said, it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary.	我是中文句子
But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today’s asymmetric conflicts, victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield.	我是中文句子
Only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results.	我是中文句子
A Farewell to Nuclear Arms	我是中文句子
For all our differences, Reagan and I shared the strong conviction that civilized countries should not make such barbaric weapons the linchpin of their security.	我是中文句子
Even though we failed to achieve our highest aspirations in Reykjavik, the summit was nonetheless, in the words of my former counterpart, “a major turning point in the quest for a safer and secure world.”	我是中文句子
The next few years may well determine if our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever be realized.	我是中文句子
Critics present nuclear disarmament as unrealistic at best, and a risky utopian dream at worst.	我是中文句子
They point to the Cold War’s “long peace” as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only means of staving off a major war.	我是中文句子
As someone who has commanded these weapons, I strongly disagree.	我是中文句子
Nuclear deterrence has always been a hard and brittle guarantor of peace.	我是中文句子
That catastrophe must be forestalled.	我是中文句子
The trust and understanding built at Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties.	我是中文句子
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty destroyed the feared quick-strike missiles then threatening Europe’s peace.	我是中文句子
But prospects for progress on arms control and nonproliferation are darkening in the absence of a credible push for nuclear disarmament.	我是中文句子
I learned during those two long days in Reykjavik that disarmament talks could be as constructive as they are arduous.	我是中文句子
By linking an array of interrelated matters, Reagan and I built the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nuclear-arms race of which we had lost control.	我是中文句子
In retrospect, the Cold War’s end heralded the coming of a messier arrangement of global power and persuasion.	我是中文句子
The nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume “good faith” negotiations for disarmament.	我是中文句子
Only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the reassurance and the credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine.	我是中文句子
We can no longer afford, politically or financially, the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear “haves” and “have-nots.”	我是中文句子
Reykjavik proved that boldness is rewarded.	我是中文句子
Conditions were far from favorable for a disarmament deal in 1986.	我是中文句子
Before I became Soviet leader in 1985, relations between the Cold War superpowers had hit rock bottom.	我是中文句子
Reagan and I were nonetheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant outreach and face-to-face interaction.	我是中文句子
Economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster helped spur us to action.	我是中文句子
Why has the Great Recession and the disastrous meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan not elicited a similar response today?	我是中文句子
A first step would be for the US finally to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama has endorsed this treaty as a vital instrument to discourage proliferation and avert nuclear war.	我是中文句子
This step must be related to limits on missile defense, one of the key issues that undermined the Reykjavik summit.	我是中文句子
Our world remains too militarized.	我是中文句子
In today’s economic climate, nuclear weapons have become loathsome money pits.	我是中文句子
These deliberations would yield greater security for less money.	我是中文句子
But the buildup of conventional military forces – driven in large part by the enormous military might deployed globally by the US – must be addressed as well.	我是中文句子
As we engage in furthering our Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement, we should seriously consider reducing the burden of military budgets and forces globally.	我是中文句子
The example of Reykjavik should remind us that palliative measures are not enough.	我是中文句子
Affirmative Action for Europe	我是中文句子
The violence in France, fueled by staggering unemployment and ruthless policing, reflects the utter failure of the French model of social integration.	我是中文句子
As the riots in France fade, French politicians are agonizing about how to proceed.	我是中文句子
Forty years ago, after legal segregation of blacks and whites formally ended in America, the United States was confronted by similar problems.	我是中文句子
America’s response shows, however, that integration cannot be viewed as a one-way street.	我是中文句子
In addition to imposing demands and constraints on minorities to join the mainstream, society must be willing to demand of itself that it make room for all its citizens.	我是中文句子
But, in the early 1970’s, President Richard M. Nixon expanded the scope of affirmative action.	我是中文句子
But they remain in existence three decades later.	我是中文句子
Similarly, anchormen and anchorwomen from all ethnic backgrounds populate American television news programs.	我是中文句子
Affirmative action in the US has been effective in creating a large African-American middle class.	我是中文句子
Indeed, in the US, more people of color and women hold top jobs in the public and private sector than anywhere else in the world.	我是中文句子
Affirmative action programs, of course, have always been vulnerable to attack by those who can’t benefit from them.	我是中文句子
The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the program was constitutional, citing a “compelling state interest” in racial diversity.	我是中文句子
They argued that the skills needed in today’s global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to a wide diversity of people.	我是中文句子
Retired military officers and commanders told the court that affirmative action was essential to maintaining an integrated officer corps.	我是中文句子
What America’s affirmative action programs may not do is set quotas for minorities, as this prevents competition between different groups.	我是中文句子
But, in comparing groups, it is permitted to use an individual’s status as member of an under-represented minority in his or her favor.	我是中文句子
As a result, a university may select a black student with a satisfactory score on the admissions test, even if there is a white student with a better score.	我是中文句子
From the current French viewpoint, however, laws and regulations based on ethnicity are regarded as an unwelcome encroachment on the Republican ideal.	我是中文句子
French President Jacques Chirac vehemently opposes quotas for immigrants, out of fear that such a policy would stigmatize groups.	我是中文句子
And French businesses don’t see it as their role to solve the problems of the suburbs.	我是中文句子
France does have affirmative action programs, but they address poverty, not ethnicity.	我是中文句子
Affordable Green Energy	我是中文句子
Specifically, we are told, the goal should be a 50% reduction in global carbon-dioxide emissions by the middle of the century.	我是中文句子
Even its backers concede that achieving this target won’t be easy – and they are right.	我是中文句子
In fact, they are so right that they are wrong.	我是中文句子
Allow me to explain.	我是中文句子
For all the talk about solar, wind, and other hyped green-energy sources, they make up only 0.6% of global energy consumption. Renewable energy overwhelmingly comes from often-unsustainable burning of wood and biomass by people in the Third World.	我是中文句子
Fossil fuels account for more than four-fifths of the world’s energy diet.	我是中文句子
Can we do this?	我是中文句子
According to the International Energy Agency, here’s what it would take to achieve the goal of cutting emissions by 50% between now and mid-century:	我是中文句子
That’s not a lot of bang for the buck.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, there is a better, smarter way to deal with global warming.	我是中文句子
But think where we’d be if we could improve the efficiency of solar cells by a factor of ten – in other words, if we could make them cheaper than fossil fuels.	我是中文句子
We wouldn’t have to force (or subsidize) anyone to stop burning coal and oil.	我是中文句子
Can we achieve this technological miracle over the next 20 to 40 years?	我是中文句子
In a word, yes.	我是中文句子
How large?	我是中文句子
This belief in the potential of technological progress strikes some climate activists as naïve or even delusional.	我是中文句子
But is it really?	我是中文句子
Consider one of the miracles of the modern age – the personal computer.	我是中文句子
These devices didn’t become household items because governments subsidized purchases or forced up the price of typewriters and slide rules.	我是中文句子
We can do the same for clean energy.	我是中文句子
Afghanistan Is Lost Without Better Governance	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – President Obama's recent trip to Afghanistan highlighted the growing American and international perception that without better governance Afghanistan will fail.	我是中文句子
As President Obama apparently made clear in his late night meeting with President Hamid Karzai, no matter what other progress is made, America and its allies cannot succeed in Afghanistan unless the Afghan government succeeds—and that government is moving in the wrong direction.	我是中文句子
The ongoing Marja campaign, the arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and two Taliban "shadow governors" in Pakistan, and the recent drone strike hitting top leaders of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Haqqani network are all clear steps in the right direction.	我是中文句子
To this end, Obama launched an 18-month military "surge" with the backing of other NATO member countries, to be followed by the beginning of withdrawal.	我是中文句子
To achieve these goals in such a short time, NATO and its Afghan partners must overcome three enormous obstacles.	我是中文句子
First, they must fight far more successfully against the Taliban to create space for rebuilding and possible negotiation.	我是中文句子
Second, they must convince Pakistan to begin actively opposing the Afghan Taliban and denying them the safe haven and support they currently receive in Pakistan.	我是中文句子
Third, they must support the emergence of a legitimate Afghan government that is not, unlike the current government, seen as corrupt and ineffectual by its citizens.	我是中文句子
Recent efforts by President Hamid Karzai’s administration to limit its public accountability demonstrate that the Afghan government in its current form lacks either the capacity or the willingness to do so.	我是中文句子
At that time, these officials argued that the elections would give Afghanistan’s leaders a clear mandate for reform.	我是中文句子
The deeply discredited elections put an end to those hopes.	我是中文句子
The original flaw of the 2009 elections was structural. There was no voter list, and so it was nearly impossible to prevent ballot-stuffing.	我是中文句子
The body empowered to conduct the vote, the Independent Election Commission, was run by commissioners all appointed by and partial to one candidate, Karzai.	我是中文句子
Only the presence of the ECC, particularly its international commissioners, and the hope that it would ensure at least some fairness into the process prevented the electoral controversy from erupting into open conflict.	我是中文句子
As flawed as the elections were and as contentious as the outcome ultimately was, the situation would have been far worse without the ECC.	我是中文句子
In a high-profile speech in London this past January, Karzai pledged to make progress in fighting corruption and promoting government accountability.	我是中文句子
Instead, the opposite appears to be happening.	我是中文句子
NATO and the international community must do everything possible to foster accountable government at all levels in Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
Although Afghanistan's government does not need to be fully centralized, Afghanistan cannot succeed if the central government fails.	我是中文句子
The 18-month clock is ticking.	我是中文句子
No Exit from Afghanistan	我是中文句子
NEW DELHI – Despite frequent turmoil and repeated invasions, Afghanistan has remained virtually unchanged for centuries.	我是中文句子
Nearly 120 years ago, Winston Churchill described the futility of warfare in the region: “Financially it is ruinous.	我是中文句子
Morally it is wicked.	我是中文句子
Militarily it is an open question, and politically it is a blunder.”	我是中文句子
But the reality is that the US is scuttling from a conflict that it has lost, just as it did in Vietnam almost 40 years ago, leaving the beleaguered population to its own devices.	我是中文句子
Rather than admit defeat, US officials are resorting to diversionary rhetoric.	我是中文句子
Kerry’s insistence that the US is not withdrawing, but “drawing down,” is a similarly transparent attempt at manipulation.	我是中文句子
To be sure, America’s presence in Afghanistan has spawned important regional linkages; unfortunately, they are not the kind that support economic renewal.	我是中文句子
In fact, the Taliban’s confidence already drove them to disrupt plans for peace talks with the Afghan government.	我是中文句子
The Afghan government responded by suspending talks with the Taliban, as well as the status-of-forces negotiations with the US.	我是中文句子
Pakistan recommends seeking an alternate venue for the negotiations with the Taliban, rather than abandoning reconciliation efforts altogether.	我是中文句子
(Indeed, Karzai has reportedly already met with Taliban representatives for secret talks aimed at restarting the stalled peace initiative.)	我是中文句子
Fortunately for the US, the Taliban is no longer a homogeneous group.	我是中文句子
A decade of running and hiding from unrelenting surveillance and targeted drone attacks has caused the movement to splinter.	我是中文句子
The Taliban may no longer be a unified force, but they clearly remain a dangerous one.	我是中文句子
All of these developments have put India in a difficult position.	我是中文句子
In order to make the best of a grim situation, India must be prepared to protect its own interests at all costs.	我是中文句子
After all, as the US extricates itself from its Afghan quagmire, its own national interests will continue to trump all other considerations.	我是中文句子
But China, Pakistan, and Iran also have their own important national-security interests in Afghanistan that each will now do their utmost to guarantee.	我是中文句子
Afghanistan’s Customary Anguish	我是中文句子
Collective decisions are taken by patriarchs in councils called jirgas, where all have to be in agreement.	我是中文句子
This agreement includes including collaborating or not with the Taliban, cooperating with the Coalition forces, accepting or refusing poppy eradication in a village.	我是中文句子
Every act of an Afghan male’s life is integrated in a form of reciprocity, in which nothing is free.	我是中文句子
Women are excluded from collective decision-making, as they are mere objects.	我是中文句子
The younger the girl, the higher the price.	我是中文句子
Marriage, especially in the provinces, is routinely consummated on pre-pubescent bodies.	我是中文句子
Yet women are precious in their own way.	我是中文句子
The all-covering burqa ensures sufficient anonymity to permit women a certain amount of freedom in public space.	我是中文句子
Every female simultaneously carries her father’s and her husband’s honor, and will stoically submit to all forms of violence committed in its name.	我是中文句子
Going to court is practically unheard of, as it would mean renouncing family practices.	我是中文句子
As violence is strictly a private matter, relinquishing justice to state institutions could be an unacceptable humiliation.	我是中文句子
Customary law is not rigid in that it is made to fit round the demands of global economy.	我是中文句子
Yet an awareness of alternatives is seeping in through the media, even in remote provinces.	我是中文句子
Iranian films and the much loved Indian TV serials, not to mention the occasional American film, influence peoples' expectations.	我是中文句子
Add to that the experience of having lived abroad as refugees in Pakistan and Iran.	我是中文句子
Violence and murder of women are on the increase, perpetrated by men who feel that these alternatives pose a threat to their authority.	我是中文句子
The West imagines that religion is the central issue in Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
Governments and international aid organizations have failed to take into consideration the role of Farhang, perhaps because the power of unwritten law remains largely inconceivable in the West.	我是中文句子
But Afghanistan cannot begin to solve its many problems until it criminalizes the privatized violence of this antiquated code.	我是中文句子
Afghanistan’s Drug-Friendly Environment	我是中文句子
That lesson should have been absorbed and understood, not least by American strategists, long before the Taliban’s fall.	我是中文句子
But the Taliban’s rapid rise in the 1990’s was inextricably linked to the failure of irrigation systems.	我是中文句子
Villagers whose crops shriveled and whose livestock died in a prolonged drought saw joining the Taliban as an economic opportunity.	我是中文句子
Had there been more irrigation, the Taliban’s gains might have been far less impressive.	我是中文句子
The Taliban are now an increasingly spent force, but lack of water reinforced the logic of opium production across its former strongholds in the south.	我是中文句子
Clear-cutting of old growth forests in the mountains bordering Pakistan may prove as problematic.	我是中文句子
These sorts of trees can be restored, given a concerted campaign and investment in nurseries to produce local varieties.	我是中文句子
Loss of the ancient cedar, pine, fir, and oak forests on the slopes above is another matter.	我是中文句子
Forestry has always been a problem in Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
Aerial photographers were called in, and a large budget was set aside.	我是中文句子
But, in 1976, the FAO admitted in a new plan that forest and watershed management activities had “turned out to be quite limited.”	我是中文句子
Up to 60% of the old growth forest in Nangahar, the second largest opium-producing province, may have been cut during the war years.	我是中文句子
Illegal logging continues today, with only ineffectual efforts made to stop it.	我是中文句子
At the current rate, Afghanistan’s old growth forest could vanish within a decade.	我是中文句子
Safety concerns and cost also limit intervention by international conservation organizations.	我是中文句子
Illegal logging crews number 200 or more.	我是中文句子
The price of plank cedar in Lahore is incentive enough to corrupt, or kill, any Green Corps men brave enough to stand in their way.	我是中文句子
Environmental issues are of paramount importance in marginal countries because their impact on human survival is immediate and direct.	我是中文句子
Afghanistan’s Feminist Revolution	我是中文句子
Both houses of Parliament had approved the law, and President Hamid Karzai signed it.	我是中文句子
The law now affects only the Shia minority, but threatens to affect pending legislation that could restrict the rights of non-Shia women as well.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, the feminism expressed by women such as these Afghani heroines should educate us in the West about our own shortcomings.	我是中文句子
This global uproar is a testament to how three decades of Western feminist challenges to leadership have changed the world for the better.	我是中文句子
But our (Western) moment of feminist leadership is over now – for good reasons.	我是中文句子
We know by now what our problems are as women in the West, and we know the blueprint for solving them.	我是中文句子
What we lack now is not analysis, but the organizational and political will to do so.	我是中文句子
So the leadership role is shifting to women in the developing world.	我是中文句子
Afghanistan’s Opium War	我是中文句子
When NATO leaders meet for their summit in Riga at the end of this month, there will be a ghost at the feast: Afghanistan’s opium.	我是中文句子
Indeed, NATO’s top general, James Jones, has called drugs the “Achilles heel” of Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
This year’s record harvest of 6,100 tons of opium will generate more than $3 billion in illicit revenue – equivalent to almost half of Afghanistan’s GDP.	我是中文句子
Profits for drug traffickers downstream will be almost 20 times that amount.	我是中文句子
Opium money is corrupting Afghan society from top to bottom.	我是中文句子
High-level collusion enables thousands of tons of chemical precursors, needed to produce heroin, to be trucked into the country.	我是中文句子
Armed convoys transport raw opium around the country unhindered.	我是中文句子
Sometimes even army and police vehicles are involved.	我是中文句子
Guns and bribes ensure that the trucks are waved through checkpoints.	我是中文句子
Opiates flow freely across borders into Iran, Pakistan, and other Central Asian countries.	我是中文句子
The opium fields of wealthy landowners are untouched, because local officials are paid off.	我是中文句子
Major traffickers never come to trial because judges are bribed or intimidated.	我是中文句子
Senior government officials take their cut of opium revenues or bribes in return for keeping quiet.	我是中文句子
Perversely, some provincial governors and government officials are themselves major players in the drug trade.	我是中文句子
As a result, the Afghan state is at risk of takeover by a malign coalition of extremists, criminals, and opportunists.	我是中文句子
Opium is choking Afghan society.	我是中文句子
Within Afghanistan, drug addiction is rising.	我是中文句子
Neighbors that used to be transit states for drugs are now major consumers, owing to similar dramatic increases in opium and heroin addiction.	我是中文句子
Intravenous drug use is spreading HIV/AIDS in Iran, Central Asia, and the former Soviet Union.	我是中文句子
What can be done?	我是中文句子
First, the veil of corruption in Afghanistan must be lifted.	我是中文句子
It is time for the Afghan government to name, shame, and sack corrupt officials, arrest major drug traffickers and opium landlords, and seize their assets.	我是中文句子
Donors have trained police and prosecutors and built courts and detention centers.	我是中文句子
Now it is up to the government to use the judicial system to impose the rule of law.	我是中文句子
It will be difficult, but not impossible, to re-establish confidence in the central government.	我是中文句子
Putting major drug traffickers behind bars at the new maximum-security prison at Pul-i-Charki, near Kabul, would be a good start.	我是中文句子
Of course, Afghanistan does not bear sole responsibility for its plight.	我是中文句子
The heroin trade would not be booming if Western governments were serious about combating drug consumption.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, Afghanistan’s neighbors must do more to stop insurgents, weapons, money, and chemical precursors from flowing across their borders into the country.	我是中文句子
Coalition forces should take a more robust approach to the drug problem.	我是中文句子
Counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics are two sides of the same coin.	我是中文句子
Improving security and the rule of law must include destroying the opium trade.	我是中文句子
Allowing opium traffickers to operate with impunity gives them a free hand to raise money to pay for the arms and fighters battling the Afghan army and NATO forces.	我是中文句子
The United Nations Security Council has authorized the International Security Assistance Force to take all necessary measures to fulfill its mandate.	我是中文句子
And they should be given the tools and manpower to do the job.	我是中文句子
There is no point in trying to win the hearts and minds of major drug traffickers.	我是中文句子
Farmers are a different story.	我是中文句子
Forced eradication risks pushing farmers into the hands of extremists, and thus will not lead to the sustainable reduction of opium fields.	我是中文句子
Indeed, as we have seen in some Andean countries, it can be counter-productive.	我是中文句子
Therefore, security and development must go hand in hand.	我是中文句子
To achieve this, Afghanistan needs more development assistance.	我是中文句子
International support so far has been generous, but it is still well below per capita equivalents for other post-conflict situations – and the need is much greater.	我是中文句子
Farmers will be weaned off opium over the long term only if they have sustainable livelihoods.	我是中文句子
At the moment, Afghanistan’s drug lords are prospering, and rural communities are suffering.	我是中文句子
That situation needs to be reversed.	我是中文句子
We must punish the traffickers and reward the farmers.	我是中文句子
We cannot afford to fail in Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
Recent history has given us graphic evidence of what would happen if we do.	我是中文句子
But any solution in Afghanistan depends on eliminating its opium.	我是中文句子
Afghanistan’s Terrorized Women	我是中文句子
Over the past ten years, the AIHRC has received more than 19,000 complaints related to violence against women.	我是中文句子
Since 2002, many efforts have been made to improve women’s lives in Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
But laws and policies alone are not sufficient to protect women from horrific domestic abuse.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the Gul case is hardly the only well-publicized case.	我是中文句子
The husband of another young woman, Aisha, cut off her nose and ears when she ran away.	我是中文句子
Second, there is a strong political incentive to deprive women of their rights.	我是中文句子
Radical groups receive immense support from the large share of the population that opposes women’s rights.	我是中文句子
The Taliban, for example, have consistently used an anti-women policy to appeal to tribal and rural people.	我是中文句子
Third, family pride and honor are deemed more important than a woman’s individual well-being and safety.	我是中文句子
For example, if family members beat or abuse a woman, she has few options.	我是中文句子
Often, her only choice is to remain silent or risk disgracing the family.	我是中文句子
If she does report the matter to the authorities, the case will almost certainly never be properly investigated, nor the perpetrators ever prosecuted.	我是中文句子
Finally, while the Taliban lost power ten years ago, discrimination and violence against women has occurred in Afghan society for centuries.	我是中文句子
Thus, despite some progress, public and official sensitivity to violence against women is only slowly emerging.	我是中文句子
The Afghan government must take several steps to protect women fully.	我是中文句子
Above all, perpetrators of violence against women should be prosecuted and tried under due process of law.	我是中文句子
This will require strengthening the rule of law and ending the prevailing culture of impunity.	我是中文句子
That, in turn, requires educating the public further about human rights and women’s rights through school textbooks, continuing education courses, and a vigorous media campaign.	我是中文句子
Perhaps most importantly, non-constitutional justice systems, such as sharia, must be monitored and checked, if not prohibited altogether.	我是中文句子
As for Sahar Gul, her case must be thoroughly investigated, and the police and judiciary must commit to bringing her torturers to justice.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, Gul’s case, and others like it, should be studied in order to understand the roots of such crimes.	我是中文句子
Until Afghanistan’s leaders begin to address this problem seriously, our country will continue to bear the scar of violence against women on its face.	我是中文句子
A Flat World and a Round Ball	我是中文句子
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching, now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal.	我是中文句子
This year’s Cup, unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002, didn’t witness any real upsets in the first round.	我是中文句子
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round, and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat, with only Ghana advancing.	我是中文句子
Otherwise, we’re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany, in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere.	我是中文句子
As for Germany and the Germans, one hardly recognizes one’s own country and people.	我是中文句子
Even Mother Nature has played along.	我是中文句子
The weather is Mediterranean, and all of a sudden, so are the people.	我是中文句子
The Cup’s organization has been exceptional (as was to be expected), with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance.	我是中文句子
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world (which was not expected).	我是中文句子
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer (which nobody could have expected!).	我是中文句子
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace.	我是中文句子
But the Germans, undaunted by it all, simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world.	我是中文句子
The black, red, and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before, but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones.	我是中文句子
In fact, the flags of many nations fly alongside German.	我是中文句子
In Berlin, as in other large German cities, taxis sport the flags of their drivers’ home countries – from Angola to Saudi Arabia.	我是中文句子
Fans don not just their nations’ flags, but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries’ colors.	我是中文句子
Flags are flown in hope of victory, but also serve to dry the tears of defeat.	我是中文句子
In short, Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night’s dream, with a touch of Woodstock to boot.	我是中文句子
Outside the stadiums, public screenings of the games have become joyous mass “happenings.”	我是中文句子
And how is the soccer?	我是中文句子
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone.	我是中文句子
First, Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer.	我是中文句子
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity.	我是中文句子
Second, international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation.	我是中文句子
Spain, Argentina, and Germany, to name but a few countries, have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game.	我是中文句子
On the French, English, and Portuguese teams, too, it is the young players that have shone – despite the continuing presence of Zidane, Beckham, and Figo.	我是中文句子
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002.	我是中文句子
This generational change is accelerated by a third development.	我是中文句子
At the top international level, soccer has become faster and more athletic, and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively.	我是中文句子
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does.	我是中文句子
For now, we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new, young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted, enthralling, and beautiful to watch.	我是中文句子
Let’s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9, we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible.	我是中文句子
A Free Lunch for America	我是中文句子
But, on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans have no reason to feel smug.	我是中文句子
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of 1% per year.	我是中文句子
Suppose that – as seems to be the case – the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two.	我是中文句子
And, with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs, the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future.	我是中文句子
The impressive gains don’t stop there.	我是中文句子
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $20 billion a year of income and social welfare.	我是中文句子
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $20 billion a year in higher production.	我是中文句子
And half of the extra $1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households.	我是中文句子
So, what are the likely costs of an extra $500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years?	我是中文句子
For starters, the $500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity.	我是中文句子
So the net result would be a $200 billion increase in the national debt.	我是中文句子
The $40 billion a year of higher economic activity would, however, generate roughly $10 billion a year in additional tax revenue.	我是中文句子
Households win, too, because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes.	我是中文句子
Companies win, because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure.	我是中文句子
The unemployed win, because some of them get jobs. And even bond investors win, because they get their money back, with the interest for which they contracted.	我是中文句子
So what is not to like?	我是中文句子
Nothing.	我是中文句子
How, you might ask, can I say this?	我是中文句子
But there are two things different about today.	我是中文句子
First, the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole.	我是中文句子
Second, bond investors are being really stupid.	我是中文句子
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors’ extraordinary and irrational panic.	我是中文句子
They are willing to pay 6% per year for “safety.”	我是中文句子
Right now, however, the US government can manufacture “safety” out of thin air merely by printing bonds.	我是中文句子
A French Presidential Primer	我是中文句子
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that “a week is a long time in politics.”	我是中文句子
For Sarkozy, “rupture” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices.	我是中文句子
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today’s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate.	我是中文句子
Sarkozy’s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America’s military adventure in Iraq, but that their style was disastrously wrong.	我是中文句子
In the case of Royal, the meaning of “rupture” is both more obvious and more visible.	我是中文句子
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic.	我是中文句子
To achieve her goal, she prefers to emphasize her “essence,” thereby countering Sarkozy’s stress on his record as a “doer.”	我是中文句子
Hiding behind the originality (in French presidential politics) of her gender, Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program.	我是中文句子
Thus, Royal’s program is her popularity.	我是中文句子
In foreign policy, one can only guess what her priorities would be.	我是中文句子
As far as Europe is concerned, she seems as “agnostic” as Sarkozy, who, like her, incarnates a new generation of “post-European” leaders.	我是中文句子
In terms of values, Royal, too, seems to represent a rupture with May 1968, with her emphasis on discipline and family.	我是中文句子
According to public opinion polls, Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy.	我是中文句子
Her support is particularly strong among women voters.	我是中文句子
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy.	我是中文句子
To a large extent, Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more, whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less.	我是中文句子
As in 2002, the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less.	我是中文句子
But one way or the other, personalities will prevail over programs.	我是中文句子
A Fresh Start for China and Japan?	我是中文句子
The Japanese media’s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative, and it was remembered as a public-relations disaster.	我是中文句子
His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China, leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005.	我是中文句子
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country’s long-term interests.	我是中文句子
Hu’s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen.	我是中文句子
He will emphasize common strategic interests, highlight mutual economic benefits, generate positive public opinion, and promote further exchanges.	我是中文句子
It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the father of today’s prime minister, signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China.	我是中文句子
Behind the smiles, the polite interactions, and the cautiously worded diplomatic language, strong undercurrents of suspicion remain.	我是中文句子
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea.	我是中文句子
Then there are strategic suspicions.	我是中文句子
Fukuda has dropped Abe’s talk about an “arch of freedom” – an effort to forge a bloc with the United States, Australia, and India.	我是中文句子
Moreover, today’s “warm politics, cool economics” trend is the reverse of the “cold politics, warm economics” pattern under Koizumi.	我是中文句子
Recent food safety issues, such as the “poisoned dumplings” cases, have clearly heightened the Japanese public’s sensitivity about Chinese exports.	我是中文句子
Finally, historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems.	我是中文句子
A Fresh Start for Europe	我是中文句子
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda.	我是中文句子
These points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU’s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy.	我是中文句子
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities.	我是中文句子
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy – something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders.	我是中文句子
It won’t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe, but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price.	我是中文句子
By much the same token, Europe’s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans’ sense of a shared history and common values.	我是中文句子
A stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multi-cultural society that demographers regard as inevitable.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals.	我是中文句子
How to Help the African Dust Bowl	我是中文句子
SEATTLE – Picture a small farm under a blazing hot sky.	我是中文句子
An intense drought is afflicting the surrounding region, prospects for the next harvest are bleak, and the financial system lacks the capacity to provide the loans farmers need to get by.	我是中文句子
This scenario describes today’s southern Africa, which is in the grips of an epic drought.	我是中文句子
As it happens, it also describes eastern Nebraska in the “Dust Bowl” years of the early 1930s – a period through which my own family lived.	我是中文句子
My father, Ralph Raikes, was the first in his family to graduate from college.	我是中文句子
He never made it.	我是中文句子
He had to stay in Nebraska and help my grandfather save the family farm from the banks, which had already repossessed one-third of the land.	我是中文句子
The most important change my father made was in his mindset: he came to think of the farm not as a subsistence operation, but as a family business.	我是中文句子
He turned to the University of Nebraska, where he had received his undergraduate degree, and acquired hybrid corn and other improved seeds that the university was developing.	我是中文句子
Then he tracked inputs and weather conditions, which was rarely done at that time.	我是中文句子
My father realized that he couldn’t go it alone, and that he would need better access to financing.	我是中文句子
He also helped found the Nebraska Farm Business Association, which aggregated the data that he and his peers collected, so that they could determine best practices.	我是中文句子
And he worked together with my mother, Alice, who ran the family poultry business.	我是中文句子
Farm Credit and the University of Nebraska’s labs and greenhouses emerged out of United States government programs that had been created to improve the agriculture sector’s performance.	我是中文句子
That sector was under water in 1933; with one-quarter of the population living on farms at the time, more investment was needed.	我是中文句子
Federal farm programs treated farming as a business enterprise, enabling businessmen like my father to prosper.	我是中文句子
Eighty years later, African farmers need to make the same switch, by treating their subsistence operations as family-owned enterprises.	我是中文句子
But, as a recent report from the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) makes clear, government investment must follow the science.	我是中文句子
Those 13 countries have experienced marked improvements in agricultural production, per capita GDP, and nutrition.	我是中文句子
Only about 6% of rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa receive loans from financial institutions.	我是中文句子
African farmers growing new crop varieties are increasing their yields by only 28%, compared to 88% for farmers in Asia.	我是中文句子
My parents made certain that all five of their children graduated from college.	我是中文句子
Like them, farmers everywhere want to ensure that their children lead healthy, prosperous lives; and they all recognize the importance of education.	我是中文句子
The farmers I have met around the world often just want to sell enough extra produce to pay their health bills and put their children through school.	我是中文句子
They take advantage of opportunities when they arise, and they position their children to reap larger profits in the future.	我是中文句子
One hopes that an American story of economic progress, like that of my family, will soon be an African story, too.	我是中文句子
With so many new innovations becoming available, Africa’s family farmers need their governments to invest in their future.	我是中文句子
If they do, that future will look much better than today’s dusty and desperate reality.	我是中文句子
Africa at Risk	我是中文句子
ADDIS ABABA – Climate change will hit Africa – a continent that has contributed virtually nothing to bring it about – first and hardest.	我是中文句子
Aside from Antarctica, Africa is the only continent that has not industrialized.	我是中文句子
Indeed, since 1980’s the industrialization that had taken place in Africa has by and large been reversed.	我是中文句子
Africa has thus contributed nothing to the historical accumulation of greenhouse gases through carbon-based industrialization.	我是中文句子
Moreover, its current contribution is also negligible, practically all of it coming from deforestation and degradation of forests and farmland.	我是中文句子
We know what the impact of periodic droughts have been on the lives of tens of millions of Africans.	我是中文句子
We can therefore imagine what the impact of a drier climate on agriculture is likely to be.	我是中文句子
Conditions in this vital economic sector will become even more precarious than they currently are.	我是中文句子
Africa will not only be hit hardest, but it will be hit first.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the long dreaded impact of climate change is already upon us.	我是中文句子
The current drought covering much of East Africa – far more severe than past droughts – has been directly associated with climate change.	我是中文句子
The upcoming climate negotiations ought to address the specific problems of Africa and similarly vulnerable poor parts of the world.	我是中文句子
Second, adequate resources should be made available to poor and vulnerable regions and countries to enable them to adapt to climate change.	我是中文句子
It has created a more hostile environment for development. No amount of money will undo the damage done.	我是中文句子
But adequate investment in mitigating the damage could partly resolve the problem.	我是中文句子
Developed countries are thus morally obliged to pay partial compensation to poor and vulnerable countries and regions to cover part of the cost of the investments needed to adapt to climate change.	我是中文句子
Various estimates have been made of the scale of investment required by those countries.	我是中文句子
A transitional financing arrangement would be put in place for the period 2010-2015.	我是中文句子
Some argue that developed countries cannot come up with such sums, particularly given their current economic challenges.	我是中文句子
But no one has so far argued that the cost of damage caused to the development prospects of poor countries and regions is less than the amount of compensation being offered to cover adjustment costs.	我是中文句子
The reason is obvious: the damage caused is many times higher than the compensation being requested.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, it is argued, whatever the real cost of the damage, developed countries currently cannot afford to provide that kind of money.	我是中文句子
When the good times ended, taxpayers and governments were prepared to rescue them and to ensure that they continued to receive their extraordinary bonuses.	我是中文句子
Clearly this is not about the availability of resources. It is about the inappropriate priorities in how resources are allocated.	我是中文句子
I cannot believe that people in developed counties, when informed about the issues, would support rescuing bankers and oppose partial compensation for poor countries and regions.	我是中文句子
I cannot believe that they will let such an injustice occur.	我是中文句子
If they are not expressing their outrage over the injustice of it all, it can only be because they are inadequately informed.	我是中文句子
Three Humanitarian Challenges for Africa in 2018	我是中文句子
NAIROBI – In mid-2017, when a cholera outbreak in Somalia threatened to overwhelm local hospitals, health experts feared the worst.	我是中文句子
Somalia’s experience gives me great hope for Africa’s future.	我是中文句子
But it also serves as a reminder that local capacity is easily inundated during times of crisis.	我是中文句子
While some parts of Africa have become self-sufficient in terms of public health, others continue to lean heavily on global aid.	我是中文句子
For these areas, partnership is the best means of minimizing risks.	我是中文句子
In particular, three key challenges this year are likely to pose the severest tests of Africa’s ability to manage humanitarian crises.	我是中文句子
The first challenge is violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	我是中文句子
The violence has exacerbated food insecurity, with more than three million people severely undernourished.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, the Kasai crisis is expected to worsen in 2018.	我是中文句子
Below-average rainfall in 2017 stunted harvests, and most regions have not fully recovered.	我是中文句子
As humanitarian aid is channeled to the country, efforts must be made to target long-term solutions, such as improving agricultural output, educational access, and economic opportunity.	我是中文句子
But Somalia desperately needs a more holistic, long-term development strategy.	我是中文句子
Finally, the very scourge that Somalia contained last year will continue to rear its head elsewhere in the region.	我是中文句子
Although that is an ambitious target, it is achievable if international organizations and local governments work together.	我是中文句子
To succeed, however, local and international development partners must reorient their thinking; humanitarian aid alone will not solve Africa’s myriad challenges.	我是中文句子
While money is clearly needed, it must be spent more strategically to improve structural weaknesses that perpetuate instability.	我是中文句子
For example, if more funding were devoted to community-level health care projects, local organizations would be better positioned to lead when outbreaks threaten.	我是中文句子
Not only are local organizations better positioned to navigate complex cultural and linguistic landscapes; they also have more to lose if they fail.	我是中文句子
Last year was devastating for many Africans, as millions suffered from drought, hunger, and violence.	我是中文句子
But in Somalia, a coordinated response to a serious health threat offered new hope for a more secure future.	我是中文句子
Africa, Climate Change, and the G-8 Summit	我是中文句子
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has declared that the two issues at the center of the G-8 Summit this July will be African poverty and global climate change.	我是中文句子
These may seem to be distinct issues. In fact, they are linked.	我是中文句子
A trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why.	我是中文句子
One morning, I was taken to a dry riverbed at the village’s edge.	我是中文句子
Farmers were digging a pit in the riverbed, down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level.	我是中文句子
They explained that until recently this was a perennial river – one that flows throughout the year – but now the river stops flowing during the dry season.	我是中文句子
Only when the annual rains begin in the summer does water reappear in the river bed.	我是中文句子
Until then, water-starved communities dig for water, if they can find it and if they can afford to pump it out.	我是中文句子
In northern Ethiopia, as in much of Africa, the rain cycle has changed markedly in recent years.	我是中文句子
In recent years, the short rains have failed entirely, and long rains have been erratic.	我是中文句子
Hunger is omnipresent.	我是中文句子
Perhaps half of the children are severely underweight.	我是中文句子
Failures of rainfall contribute not only to famines and chronic hunger, but also to the onset of violence when hungry people clash over scarce food and water.	我是中文句子
When violence erupts in water-starved regions such as Darfur, Sudan, political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms.	我是中文句子
If they act at all, they mobilize peacekeepers, international sanctions, and humanitarian aid.	我是中文句子
One course of action must be to help impoverished African regions to “adapt” to climate change and to escape the poverty trap.	我是中文句子
Poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own.	我是中文句子
Nor should they have to.	我是中文句子
Greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered.	我是中文句子
While adaptation to climate change is necessary – because it is already occurring – this is not enough.	我是中文句子
The famines in Ethiopia and the violence in Darfur suggest what can lie ahead.	我是中文句子
Most likely, all three of these methods will have to play a role.	我是中文句子
The effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action, but, given the long lead times in overhauling the world’s energy systems, we must start now.	我是中文句子
Rich countries need to lead the way.	我是中文句子
Africans suffering from hunger and drought, and indeed poor people everywhere, have a right to ask much more of the US and other rich countries.	我是中文句子
Tony Blair is right to call on his rich-country colleagues to follow through on their unfulfilled promises.	我是中文句子
Capitalizing on Africa’s Demographic Dividend	我是中文句子
LOMÉ – Africa is home to the world’s youngest and fastest-growing population.	我是中文句子
But it is far from inevitable that it will do so.	我是中文句子
For African countries to capitalize on this demographic dividend, the future workforce must be educated, trained, and have adequate employment opportunities.	我是中文句子
Putting all the pieces in place will not be easy.	我是中文句子
These are uncertain times for the global economy.	我是中文句子
Trade tensions between the United States and China are threatening the integrity of global value chains, and Britain’s looming exit from the European Union has the potential to cause even more disruption.	我是中文句子
But as this slowdown gets priced in by stock markets around the world, new drivers of growth will emerge.	我是中文句子
Africa is well positioned to become one of them.	我是中文句子
According to the World Bank, six of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies are in Africa.	我是中文句子
Intra-African trade might be the gateway to future local and global growth, with the continent’s burgeoning population forging new opportunities across borders.	我是中文句子
Most significantly, Africa’s labor force is on the verge of a dramatic expansion.	我是中文句子
Today, 60% of Africans are younger than 25, and 41% are under the age of 15.	我是中文句子
By 2050, Africa’s youth population is expected to reach 840 million.	我是中文句子
But this massive pool of potential talent is a double-edged sword.	我是中文句子
Despite strong GDP growth over the last ten years, the majority of young people in Africa could not capture economic opportunities.	我是中文句子
Failing to employ Africa’s young people fully could marginalize an entire generation and lead them down a path of disruption for which we may not be prepared.	我是中文句子
For countries to experience job-led long-term growth, the provision of quality opportunities in agriculture is vital.	我是中文句子
If that does not happen, and quality jobs remain scarce, the economic expansion of which Africa is capable will not happen.	我是中文句子
In other words, African governments are facing a deadline to match job growth with skills training.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, at the moment, few countries are addressing this challenge effectively.	我是中文句子
According to the African Development Bank, the unemployment rate for young people in Africa is already double the rate for adults.	我是中文句子
In fact, young people are being let down even before they start looking for work.	我是中文句子
Too many primary schools suffer from crippling teacher shortages, for example, and gender discrimination prevents millions of girls from even attending high school.	我是中文句子
To overcome these shortcomings will require significant investments of political and financial capital.	我是中文句子
Some leaders are moving in this direction.	我是中文句子
On the sidelines of the PPF, the focus fell on African youth.	我是中文句子
One approach to capitalizing on Africa’s demographic boom is to expand the availability of training initiatives that pair employers’ needs with African talent.	我是中文句子
Africa’s success relies on its ability to harness its demographic dividend by equipping its youth with technological and innovative skills, which will be a catalyst for economic growth.	我是中文句子
This includes training and agriculture-focused programs to absorb skills along the value chains that connect raw materials to industries and markets across Africa.	我是中文句子
By 2030, one in every five people on the planet will be African.	我是中文句子
Because of its size alone, Africa’s labor force will have the potential to drive global growth for decades.	我是中文句子
But to do so, Africans must implement the necessary reforms today.	我是中文句子
As our demographic dividend matures, governments, institutions, and organizations must help position young people for success.	我是中文句子
If African countries can meet this challenge, prolonged economic growth – at home and abroad – will be the reward.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Path from Poverty	我是中文句子
BEIJING – All low-income countries have the potential for dynamic economic growth.	我是中文句子
The key is to capture the window of opportunity for industrialization arising from the relocation of light manufacturing from higher-income countries.	我是中文句子
That was true in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it remains true today.	我是中文句子
China, of course, is the region's most recent traveler along this well-trodden path.	我是中文句子
After more than three decades of breakneck economic growth, it has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries on earth to the world's largest economy.	我是中文句子
Indeed, ever since the Industrial Revolution, the rise of light manufacturing has driven a dramatic rise in national income.	我是中文句子
The United Kingdom's economic transformation started with textiles.	我是中文句子
In Belgium, France, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and Switzerland, light manufacturing led the way.	我是中文句子
Similarly, in the United States, cities like Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia became centers for producing textiles, garments, and shoes.	我是中文句子
Until recently, few believed that Africa, too, could become a center for modern manufacturing.	我是中文句子
But, with the right policies, there is no reason why African countries could not follow a similar trajectory.	我是中文句子
Consider land-locked Ethiopia, which only ten years ago seemed to be an especially bad bet.	我是中文句子
But then the country built an industrial park near Addis Ababa and invited the Chinese shoemaker Huajian to open a factory there.	我是中文句子
Huajian opened its doors in January 2012 with two production lines and some 600 workers.	我是中文句子
By the end of the year, it had employed 2,000 Ethiopians and doubled the country's exports of leather shoes.	我是中文句子
Today, the company has 3,500 workers in Ethiopia producing more than two million shoes a year.	我是中文句子
In 2013, spurred by Huajian's success, the Ethiopian government created a new industrial park, with space for 22 factory units.	我是中文句子
Within three months, all of them had been leased by export-oriented companies from Turkey, Korea, Taiwan, China, and elsewhere.	我是中文句子
The World Bank has provided $250 million to support the continued construction of these industrial parks.	我是中文句子
The Ethiopian success story is just the start.	我是中文句子
As investors learn more about Africa, they will increasingly see what it has to offer.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the cost of labor in Africa is competitive enough that Ethiopia could attract companies from countries as poor as Bangladesh.	我是中文句子
Africa has a surplus of agricultural labor and too few other jobs.	我是中文句子
As foreign firms launch operations in the labor-intensive sectors in which Africa has a comparative advantage, they will train the local workforce.	我是中文句子
Some workers will become managers.	我是中文句子
They will become familiar with the technology and learn how to maintain consistent quality in the production line.	我是中文句子
They will establish contacts with international buyers and investors.	我是中文句子
And, eventually, some of them will be able to raise capital and start firms of their own – export companies owned and operated by Africans.	我是中文句子
Mauritius shows the path ahead.	我是中文句子
In the 1970s, the government set up industrial parks to process textiles and garments for export.	我是中文句子
At the time, most of the owners were from Taiwan or Hong Kong; today, more than 70% of the island's industrial companies are locally owned.	我是中文句子
A carefully focused export strategy is crucial.	我是中文句子
The international development community and many African governments want to work toward regional integration, linking the markets of 55 African countries.	我是中文句子
This might have its advantages, but it should not be a priority.	我是中文句子
Africa today accounts for just 1.9% of global GDP, compared to 21% for the United States and 23% for Europe.	我是中文句子
Developing countries must use their limited resources in the most effective way, and there is no question where the most attractive opportunities in Africa are to be found.	我是中文句子
With the right growth strategy, far-reaching change can come within a person's lifetime – sometimes more than once.	我是中文句子
My native Taiwan is now a high-income economy.	我是中文句子
But when I was born there, in 1952, the island was poorer than almost every country in Africa.	我是中文句子
Then it happened to me again.	我是中文句子
I moved to mainland China in 1979, when the country's per capita income was less than one-third of Sub-Saharan Africa's.	我是中文句子
Today, China has become an upper-middle-income country, and it is on track to become a high-income country by 2020.	我是中文句子
My hope is that I can witness a third economic transformation in my lifetime, this time in Ethiopia and other countries in Africa.	我是中文句子
If they stay on the tried and tested path of those who have gone before, there is every chance that I will.	我是中文句子
The Promise of Digital Health	我是中文句子
BASEL – Africa has changed remarkably, and for the better, since I first worked as a young doctor in Angola some 20 years ago.	我是中文句子
But no change has been more obvious than the way the continent has adopted mobile technology.	我是中文句子
The benefit of mobile technologies lies in access.	我是中文句子
Barriers like geographical distance and low resources, which have long prevented billions of people from getting the care they need, are much easier to overcome in the digital age.	我是中文句子
Of course, this is not new information, and a growing number of technology-based health initiatives have taken shape in recent years.	我是中文句子
But only a few have reached scale, and achieved long-term sustainability; the majority of projects have not made it past the pilot phase.	我是中文句子
The result is a highly fragmented landscape of digital solutions – one that, in some cases, can add extra strain to existing health systems.	我是中文句子
The first step to addressing this problem is to identify which factors breed success – and which impede it.	我是中文句子
Here, perhaps the most important observation relates to how the solution is linked to the reality on the ground.	我是中文句子
After all, technology is an enabler for the innovation of health-care delivery, not an end in itself.	我是中文句子
Solutions that focus on end-users, whether health practitioners or patients, have the best chance of succeeding.	我是中文句子
Fundamental to this approach is the recognition that what users need are not necessarily the most advanced technologies, but rather solutions that are easy to use and implement.	我是中文句子
The project supports patients in self-managing their condition through regular mobile medication reminders, as well as advice on necessary lifestyle changes.	我是中文句子
This approach is successful because it is patient-centered and leverages information and communication technology (ICT) tools that are readily available and commonly used.	我是中文句子
For health practitioners, digital solutions must be perceived as boosting efficiency, rather than adding to their already-heavy workload.	我是中文句子
Co-creating solutions with people experienced in delivering health care in low-resource settings can help to ensure that the solutions are adopted at scale.	我是中文句子
The network connects frontline health workers with a simple phone call to consultation centers in referral hospitals several hours away, where doctors and specialists are available around-the-clock.	我是中文句子
To realize the full potential of digital health, solutions need to be integrated into national health systems.	我是中文句子
Only then can digital technology accelerate progress toward universal health coverage and address countries’ priority health needs.	我是中文句子
Collaboration across the health and ICT sectors, both public and private, is essential.	我是中文句子
Multidisciplinary partnerships driven by the sustained leadership of senior government officials must guide progress, beginning at the planning stage.	我是中文句子
Intra-governmental collaboration, dedicated financing for digital health solutions, and effective governance mechanisms will also be vital to successful strategies.	我是中文句子
Digital technologies offer huge opportunities to improve the way health care is delivered.	我是中文句子
If we are to seize them, we must learn from past experience.	我是中文句子
By remaining focused on the reality of end-users and on priority health needs, rather than being dazzled by the latest technology, we can fulfil the promise of digital health.	我是中文句子
Confronting Africa’s Water Challenge	我是中文句子
ABIDJAN – Water is essential for life, and yet it is scarce in many parts of the world.	我是中文句子
These fragile areas now need the global community’s support.	我是中文句子
We need to build resilient systems to ensure access to potable water for all people, and to improve water-delivery and sanitation provisions in Africa’s rapidly growing urban areas.	我是中文句子
We should begin by expanding Africans’ capacity to harness wastewater.	我是中文句子
IUWM efforts require a significant initial investment, and come with steep capital and operational costs.	我是中文句子
Only a few African cities collect and treat any more than 20% of the wastewater generated through centralized wastewater-management systems.	我是中文句子
The remaining 80% constitutes a huge untapped source of potentially valuable liquid and solid waste.	我是中文句子
With the right investment, foresight, and commitment, this underappreciated resource can create jobs and deliver sustainable growth.	我是中文句子
Water will also play a key role in reaching the High 5s’ industrialization and sustainable-farming objectives.	我是中文句子
These projects also help countries to harness and use waste flows, by converting sewage to biogas and fertilizer.	我是中文句子
In February, flooding and strong winds from Tropical Storm Dineo devastated the coast of Mozambique and had a severe impact on the local population.	我是中文句子
Africa’s wastewater-management challenges are substantial and complex.	我是中文句子
Improving the quality of life for all Africans will require political commitment, public-private partnerships, and robust public involvement.	我是中文句子
With the High 5s framework, the AfDB is working to bring these three ingredients together.	我是中文句子
We have a moral obligation to do so.	我是中文句子
After all, water means life.	我是中文句子
Is Africa Still Rising?	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – Between 2000 and 2014, Africa grew at a strong clip, fueling belief in the narrative of an “Africa rising.”	我是中文句子
Such skepticism is, to some extent, understandable.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the continent's three largest economies – Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa – have experienced major declines in performance.	我是中文句子
Last year, Angola and South Africa’s economies stagnated, while the Nigerian economy actually contracted for the first time since 1991.	我是中文句子
The latest projections suggest that these economies will experience tepid recoveries in the coming years.	我是中文句子
But Africa’s skeptics have overlooked a number of important factors.	我是中文句子
That is faster than the 3.5% rate at which the global economy is currently growing.	我是中文句子
In fact, five of the ten fastest-growing economies in the world are in Africa.	我是中文句子
And over the next five years, around half of all Sub-Saharan economies will expand at an average rate similar to or higher than that which prevailed during the “Africa rising” heyday.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, high commodity prices were just one factor in the region’s strong economic performance between 2000 and 2014.	我是中文句子
Many African countries have made vast improvements to macroeconomic management, governance, and the business environment, and entrepreneurship is on the rise.	我是中文句子
Even with lower commodity prices, these developments will continue to bolster many African economies.	我是中文句子
Today’s skepticism may reflect lasting memories from a darker period, and fears that Africa’s progress has not been sufficiently consolidated.	我是中文句子
From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, dictators ruled in many African countries, and the institutions necessary for sustaining strong economic growth were fragile at best.	我是中文句子
With civil wars constantly shredding the social fabric in many countries, the continent experienced decades of tepid economic growth.	我是中文句子
But those days are gone.	我是中文句子
Policymakers across the continent have sustained the 1990s-era reforms that set the stage for the subsequent period of high growth.	我是中文句子
Although there is still much work to be done, the economic and business environment in many African countries has continued to improve, and institutions and governance have grown stronger.	我是中文句子
ICTs have also unleashed a wave of innovation and entrepreneurship across the continent.	我是中文句子
These positive trends are not likely to be reversed, and will continue to improve the economic conditions in Africa, even if commodity prices do not rebound.	我是中文句子
But that is not to say Africa will be spared from daunting challenges in the years ahead.	我是中文句子
Globally, the economic environment will become less favorable for African economies.	我是中文句子
In light of all this uncertainty, African policymakers should look inward, by focusing on policies to mobilize national resources and finance their economic agendas.	我是中文句子
Those agendas should include a number of key priorities.	我是中文句子
African countries need to diversify their economies to withstand future shocks better, while also accelerating the pace of industrialization across the continent.	我是中文句子
Governments will have to find a way to create decent jobs for the 11 million people now entering the region’s labor force every year.	我是中文句子
And they will need to enact policies to reduce poverty, and ensure that prosperity is shared across all cohorts of society.	我是中文句子
These are particularly important goals for Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa.	我是中文句子
Seeing these projects through will require competent political leaders who are committed to the principles of good governance.	我是中文句子
Failure could result in an extended period of low growth.	我是中文句子
But even if Africa’s three largest economies do end up in the doldrums, it will not necessarily seal the fate of the “Africa rising” story.	我是中文句子
After all, “Africa rising” need not mean “all” of Africa.	我是中文句子
Africa Still Rising	我是中文句子
JOHANNESBURG – Is the honeymoon over for African economies?	我是中文句子
Less than a decade ago, it seemed that the continent’s economic dreams were beginning to come true, with many countries experiencing impressive GDP growth and development.	我是中文句子
Now, as the harsh reality of the continent’s vulnerability to challenging external conditions has set in, sustaining that growth has proved difficult.	我是中文句子
But a deeper look suggests that things may not be as bad as they seem, for two key reasons.	我是中文句子
First, though average growth has declined, some African economies have thrived in recent years.	我是中文句子
That demographic trend could unlock future growth by advancing economic diversification, spurring domestic consumption, and supporting industrialization.	我是中文句子
And many lower-growth countries could head down a similar path.	我是中文句子
New research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) shows that spending by Africa’s consumers and businesses already totals $4 trillion.	我是中文句子
This represents a huge opportunity for Africa���s manufacturers.	我是中文句子
We believe that Africa can almost double its manufacturing output, to nearly $1 trillion, by 2025, with about 75% of that growth tied to production for local markets.	我是中文句子
The question is whether manufacturers will manage to exploit the growth potential that lies in front of them.	我是中文句子
African firms have not yet proved capable of meeting existing domestic demand.	我是中文句子
Africa even imports 15% of the cement it uses, despite having abundant raw materials to make it at home.	我是中文句子
To be sure, African business has made great strides in recent years.	我是中文句子
Today, 400 African companies have annual revenue of more than $1 billion, and 700 have annual revenue of more than $500 million.	我是中文句子
On the whole, these large companies are growing faster – and generating higher profits – than their global peers.	我是中文句子
But there is still a long way to go.	我是中文句子
Large African (excluding South African) firms’ average annual revenue of $2 billion is half that of large firms in Brazil, India, Mexico, and Russia.	我是中文句子
And Africa only has about 60% of the large firms it needs to put it at the same level as the emerging economies.	我是中文句子
There are eight partly overlapping regional trade zones, none of which includes more than half of Africa’s countries.	我是中文句子
Only Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa rank in the top 100 of MGI’s Global Connectedness Index.	我是中文句子
Beyond excessive trade barriers, Africa suffers from inadequate transport links and limits on the free movement of people.	我是中文句子
Africans need visas to travel to more than half the countries on their own continent.	我是中文句子
The recent launch of the African Union passport is a step in the right direction – but it is only one step.	我是中文句子
A more integrated market would not only enable African companies to create the economies of scale they need to compete; it would also be far more appealing to institutional investors.	我是中文句子
Building such a market must therefore be a top priority for African leaders, as they seek to unleash the continent’s economic potential.	我是中文句子
Equally important, Africa’s leaders must work to improve the business environment.	我是中文句子
Though some progress has been made on this front in the last two decades, non-tariff barriers remain high.	我是中文句子
Indeed, regulatory issues are still cited as a serious deterrent to investment.	我是中文句子
And almost 40% of firms surveyed by the World Bank lament the constraints imposed by competition from informal firms.	我是中文句子
Some of these issues could be addressed relatively quickly.	我是中文句子
Consider the strides Rwanda has made since 2007, when it established a development board to improve its business environment.	我是中文句子
As a result, Rwanda’s global ranking for the ease of doing business jumped from 143 in 2008 to 32 in 2014.	我是中文句子
This success can surely be replicated elsewhere in Africa.	我是中文句子
With the right policies, a relentless focus on execution, and a great deal of determination, Africa can still rise.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Arrival	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The African Development Bank (AfDB) has just published its African Economic Outlook for 2018.	我是中文句子
Africa’s rise has been a long time coming.	我是中文句子
In the 1960s, hopes were high.	我是中文句子
The Caribbean-born Nobel laureate Arthur Lewis became Nkrumah’s Chief Economic Adviser.	我是中文句子
In India, we read about these leaders’ friendship with our own post-independence prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the hope for a new dawn for all emerging economies.	我是中文句子
And many emerging economies did indeed take off.	我是中文句子
In the late 1960s, some East Asian economies surged ahead.	我是中文句子
Beginning in the early 1980s, China began its decades-long rise.	我是中文句子
And, from the early 1990s, India’s economy also began to grow robustly, with annual rates reaching the 9% range by 2005.	我是中文句子
But Africa remained stagnant, mired in poverty.	我是中文句子
The resulting political instability attracted outsiders keen to exploit governments’ weakness.	我是中文句子
Finally, at the turn of the twenty-first century, things began to change for Africa.	我是中文句子
A few dynamic leaders, democratic stirrings, and emerging regional cooperation led to a decline in poverty and a pickup in growth.	我是中文句子
Commodity exporters faced a setback around 2014, when prices plummeted.	我是中文句子
And these figures are not wishful thinking: in 2016, Ethiopia’s GDP grew by 7.6%.	我是中文句子
Of course, serious challenges remain.	我是中文句子
South Africa, the continent’s strongest economy, is now facing the difficult task of tackling its deep-rooted corruption.	我是中文句子
More broadly, many African countries need to find ways to create more employment – and fast.	我是中文句子
The share of the working-age population is rising faster in Africa than in any other region.	我是中文句子
This “demographic dividend” has immense potential.	我是中文句子
But if job creation stalls, the unemployed or under-employed are likely to become frustrated – a recipe for conflict.	我是中文句子
Consider the case of Tanzania.	我是中文句子
Thanks to President John Magufuli’s effort to mobilize more domestic revenue to support increased development spending, the economy is doing well.	我是中文句子
The same is true of Ethiopia.	我是中文句子
In the last couple of decades, the country has made great strides in export-led growth, supported by a growing industrial sector and large investments from China.	我是中文句子
Now, it is poised to take over as the economic powerhouse of East Africa.	我是中文句子
Yet the urban youth unemployment rate stands at 23.3%. Left unchecked, this situation could easily end up fueling ethnic conflict and political turmoil.	我是中文句子
As it stands, Africa receives a total of about $60 billion in foreign direct investment each year.	我是中文句子
To close the gap, African governments must attract more money.	我是中文句子
The challenges are daunting, to say the least.	我是中文句子
But there are lessons that African countries can learn from one another.	我是中文句子
For example, Ghana’s smooth transfer of power after the December 2016 election set a positive democratic example.	我是中文句子
Nigeria’s Lagos State and Tanzania have done a good job of mobilizing internal resources for development.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Schooling Without Learning	我是中文句子
Even in 2014, only 37% of the nation’s students were enrolled in secondary school, owing to high fees.	我是中文句子
The president’s move is thus an inspiring example that Ghana’s neighbors should follow.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, despite progressive reforms like these, students across Africa still face other steep barriers to a truly comprehensive education.	我是中文句子
In Ghana, for example, poor and rural children are unlikely to reap the full benefits of their new access to secondary education.	我是中文句子
The situation is arguably worse elsewhere on the continent.	我是中文句子
The issue is not only lack of access to schools, but also lack of good schools.	我是中文句子
In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that 88% of children and teenagers will enter adulthood without basic literacy.	我是中文句子
This constitutes a moral and development crisis that demands immediate action.	我是中文句子
The World Bank, which similarly raised the issue of “schooling without learning” in a new report, has corroborated my view.	我是中文句子
We cannot expect students to learn from poorly educated, poorly paid teachers.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, with the launch of the UNESCO report, several partners have already stepped up.	我是中文句子
And whoever takes over UNESCO, following the election of a new director-general next month, will have a make-or-break opportunity to craft the right agenda to meet this challenge.	我是中文句子
Currently, the organization is mired in a financial crisis and internecine disputes, and it will need a leader who has the vision to solve both internal and external problems.	我是中文句子
She has singled out the financial crisis as the biggest threat facing UNESCO and has stressed the need for greater dialogue with members in arrears, like the United States.	我是中文句子
Azoulay also has called for UNESCO to treat education as a catalyst for development and gender equality, and as the best way to help combat the “radicalization of the mind.”	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, in Africa, we know all too well what happens when efforts to construct the defenses of peace ultimately fail.	我是中文句子
The stakes for Africa are high.	我是中文句子
Our children are threatened not only by lack of access to schools, but also by lack of opportunities to learn, and by the loss of irreplaceable fragments of their rich history.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Year of Opportunity	我是中文句子
GENEVA – We are still near the start of 2018, and already it feels like tension and disorder will be the year’s defining characteristics.	我是中文句子
From anti-immigration policies in the United States to flaring geopolitical hotspots in the Middle East and East Asia, disruption, upheaval, and uncertainty seem to be the order of the day.	我是中文句子
But at least one metric offers reason for cautious optimism: economic growth.	我是中文句子
The International Monetary Fund estimates that global growth will reach 3.7% this year, up from 3.6% in 2017.	我是中文句子
It was fitting that Lagarde made that observation in Addis Ababa, because it is in Africa where the rays of prosperity are shining brightest.	我是中文句子
For starters, Africa is poised for a modest, if fragmented, growth recovery.	我是中文句子
Following three years of weak economic performance, overall growth is expected to accelerate to 3.5% this year, from 2.9% in 2017.	我是中文句子
This year’s projected gains will come amid improved global conditions, increased oil output, and the easing of drought conditions in the east and south.	我是中文句子
To be sure, growth will be uneven.	我是中文句子
While nearly a third of African economies will grow by around 5%, slowdowns are likely in at least a dozen others.	我是中文句子
Sharp increases in public debt, which has reached 50% of GDP in nearly half of Sub-Saharan countries, are particularly worrying.	我是中文句子
But, overall, Africa is positioned for a positive year.	我是中文句子
Second, Africa’s political landscape is liberalizing.	我是中文句子
In South Africa, Jacob Zuma’s resignation allowed Cyril Ramaphosa to become president.	我是中文句子
In January, Liberians witnessed their country’s first peaceful transfer of power since 1944, when former soccer star George Weah was sworn into office.	我是中文句子
All of these gains will be tested, however, as voters in 18 countries go to the polls this year.	我是中文句子
A third source of optimism is Africa’s agricultural sector, where the potential of smallholder farmers, the majority of whom are women, is finally being realized.	我是中文句子
African agricultural output is forecast to reach $1 trillion by 2030.	我是中文句子
This maturation could not have come at a more opportune time; roughly two-thirds of Africans depend on agriculture to make ends meet.	我是中文句子
Fourth, Africans are benefiting from technological disruption.	我是中文句子
With more than 995 million mobile subscribers, Africa’s increasing connectivity is being used to power innovation.	我是中文句子
Key sectors like farming, health, education, banking, and insurance are already being transformed, greatly enhancing the region’s business landscape.	我是中文句子
And with the G20 and the OECD working to stop tax avoidance, Africa may soon benefit from global efforts to end shady accounting.	我是中文句子
Sixth, Africa’s energy sector is set to thrive.	我是中文句子
In South Africa, renewable energy has taken off; the price of wind power is now competitive with coal.	我是中文句子
Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, and Rwanda are also attracting large investments in renewable energy.	我是中文句子
A seventh area showing signs of progress is education.	我是中文句子
As the Education Commission highlights, some countries are boosting investments in education.	我是中文句子
This represents an opportunity to align learning outcomes with future employment needs.	我是中文句子
But with over a billion young people living in Africa by 2050, greater investment in education is urgently needed.	我是中文句子
Finally, greater attention is being paid to developing a pan-African identity, and African fashions, films, and foods are expanding to new markets.	我是中文句子
As these cultural connections grow, Africa’s soft power will continue to rise and extend far beyond the continent.	我是中文句子
In many corners of the world, 2018 is shaping up to be yet another disappointing year, as inequality and poverty continue to fuel anger and populism.	我是中文句子
Africa will not be entirely immune from such developments.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, the continent’s inhabitants have at least eight good reasons – far more than most people elsewhere – to be optimistic.	我是中文句子
Resetting the Africa-Europe Relationship	我是中文句子
Tajani is right.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, his approach is not.	我是中文句子
Lasting solutions to Africa’s development challenges require funding, to be sure, but they also demand a significant recalibration in relations with foreign partners.	我是中文句子
And Africa’s relationship with Europe may require the biggest overhaul of all.	我是中文句子
The problem goes much deeper than money; one might even say it’s philosophical.	我是中文句子
Africa and Europe have a very old relationship, marked by complexity and pain.	我是中文句子
This patronizing partnership has run its course, and it is crucial that we change the dynamic.	我是中文句子
Meetings like the fifth African Union-European Union summit, which wrapped up last week in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, are a good start.	我是中文句子
The meeting, which focused on “investing in youth,” put a spotlight on the complex links between the sides.	我是中文句子
One conclusion was clear: the EU’s current answer to addressing migration from Africa is outdated.	我是中文句子
If Europe’s strategy to solve its migration challenges relies on money alone, it will fail.	我是中文句子
We are a long way from the lopsided dynamic that defined African-European relations during the colonial era.	我是中文句子
Today, Europe may need Africa more than Africa needs Europe, especially if one considers human capital.	我是中文句子
Over the next 15 years, some 440 million Africans will enter the job market, compared to 72 million in Europe.	我是中文句子
Africa’s job seekers will need work, and Europe will have it.	我是中文句子
An aging population is already putting a squeeze on Europe’s growth, and vacancies are forecast to multiply amid a shrinking labor pool.	我是中文句子
There is even a strong possibility that, in the long run, it will be African young people who pay for the care of European pensioners.	我是中文句子
These demographic differences underscore the potential benefits of rethinking economic and political relations.	我是中文句子
Without migration, the redistributive policies on which European welfare states depend will be unable to withstand the current rate of aging.	我是中文句子
Migration policies that emphasize mobility are essential to support European industries, household consumption and, ultimately, the financing of social benefits.	我是中文句子
Of the 375,000 students from the continent who study abroad each year, many will establish businesses and find their own place in a globalized economy upon graduation.	我是中文句子
There is already growing competition in the US, Canada, China, the Middle East, and Africa itself to attract these highly educated and mobile students.	我是中文句子
Just as sixteenth-century Europe needed African gold, twenty-first-century Europe cannot do without the African diaspora.	我是中文句子
That is why it is more important than ever that Europe not engage in an administrative bean-counting exercise, in which other economies will always appear stronger.	我是中文句子
Europe’s recognition of its need for Africa is a necessary paradigm shift, leading, one hopes, to reasoned collaboration.	我是中文句子
In an increasingly uncertain world, Africa and Europe can set the foundations for a smarter partnership by changing the basis of their cooperation.	我是中文句子
Failure to do so will be costly.	我是中文句子
But most of that cost will be borne by Europe.	我是中文句子
With alternative partners already courting their talent, it is not Africa that will be hurt the most by the missed opportunity.	我是中文句子
Gender Equity for Africa’s Scientists	我是中文句子
KIGALI – A girl in Ethiopia could grow up to engineer a new method for improving agricultural yields, if only she could meet the right mentor.	我是中文句子
A young woman in Malawi has ideas for new cancer treatments, but will never apply them if she is pushed out of school.	我是中文句子
And a girl in Rwanda has all the skills to create a mathematical model to mitigate droughts; all she needs is a research grant to help her pay for college.	我是中文句子
There is a global gender imbalance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics – the so-called STEM disciplines.	我是中文句子
But in Africa, this imbalance is doing more than threatening individual futures.	我是中文句子
It is also depriving the continent of talents and contributions needed to drive development and progress.	我是中文句子
A 2011 African Development Bank report finds that “getting women into science and technology ultimately promises to benefit society as a whole.”	我是中文句子
Gender equity in STEM is achievable, and many African scholars are showing the world how to do it.	我是中文句子
But they need help, and programs that offer scholarships and support are among the best ways to achieve parity in the sciences.	我是中文句子
Early data from a Mastercard Foundation initiative aimed at reversing these trends show that a comprehensive approach to plugging the leaks can make a difference.	我是中文句子
Success begins with acknowledging that gender equity in STEM matters.	我是中文句子
“Science needs us” is how Armanda Kouassi, an industrial engineer and former Mastercard Foundation scholar, puts it.	我是中文句子
“With different ideas and perspectives come better solutions and thinking that can move scientific innovations forward and benefit the whole of Africa.”	我是中文句子
Kouassi is right.	我是中文句子
Africa cannot afford to squander its young, female talent.	我是中文句子
Sub-Saharan Africa faces a shortfall of some 2.5 million engineers, technologists, mathematicians, and scientists.	我是中文句子
Removing gender barriers to STEM requires African governments to make equity in the sciences a priority.	我是中文句子
The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, is one of these agents of change.	我是中文句子
Of these students, an estimated 70% are expected to study science at the university level.	我是中文句子
Despite these positive developments, quotas alone will not achieve parity.	我是中文句子
To make lasting gains, opportunities outside the classroom are also needed.	我是中文句子
FAWE Rwanda also works with teachers to develop gender-responsive pedagogical methods.	我是中文句子
Inequalities faced by girls and young women in African education cannot be erased overnight.	我是中文句子
But, Rebecca adds, “It was cool being a science student.”	我是中文句子
Africa needs more women who share Rebecca’s enthusiasm for STEM.	我是中文句子
As professionals working to improve African education, we couldn’t agree more.	我是中文句子
Liberal Democracy in Africa Can Wait	我是中文句子
YAOUNDÉ – Africa’s policymakers understand that strong economic and political leadership is essential to growth and stability.	我是中文句子
For years, African economies have fared better than expected, owing to a commitment to improving governance.	我是中文句子
The question now is how to sustain the momentum.	我是中文句子
Current strategies do not provide an adequate answer.	我是中文句子
Development practitioners have long debated which model offers the best framework for reform.	我是中文句子
Put simply, “governance” refers to a dynamic framework of rules, structures, and processes that help a government manage its economic, political, and administrative affairs.	我是中文句子
But which principles a government focuses on varies by approach.	我是中文句子
The model championed by the West places a premium on human rights and democracy, while the one advocated by China is more concerned with political stability and economic growth.	我是中文句子
The rationale is that the Beijing Model is better for Africa in the short and medium term.	我是中文句子
And, while it might not be popular to admit, Trump has a point.	我是中文句子
Simply put, food, shelter, health, and good sanitation are more relevant for most Africans than the right to vote.	我是中文句子
Moreover, only a moderately wealthy population, with a healthy middle class, can adequately demand the rights that democracy provides.	我是中文句子
Paradoxically, the fastest way to build a strong middle class in Africa would be to move toward the hierarchy of principles that China’s model promotes.	我是中文句子
For Africa to reorient its governance approach, and embrace a post-Washington Consensus, its leaders must commit to improving institutional effectiveness and economic management.	我是中文句子
The first set of reforms would involve establishing clear lines of sovereignty with international partners.	我是中文句子
Africa’s relationship with Western donors, for example, has historically placed individual rights over national rights.	我是中文句子
But in my view, individual rights should not supersede sovereign ones.	我是中文句子
Punishing entire countries for laws that affect a minority is counterproductive.	我是中文句子
As a Ugandan government spokesman said at the time, the bank “should not blackmail its members” to adopt Western values.	我是中文句子
Yet, when governance models are judged solely through the lens of the Washington Consensus, there is very little alternative.	我是中文句子
Along the same lines, the second set of reforms pertains to prioritizing economic rights over political rights.	我是中文句子
For example, politicians who manage an economy well should not be subject to term limits.	我是中文句子
Neither Singapore nor China is a democracy; but leaders in both countries have used their political power to improve living standards.	我是中文句子
Forcing leaders to step down in the middle of economic reforms seems counterproductive.	我是中文句子
These are not far-fetched ideas.	我是中文句子
Today, leaders in Rwanda, which is widely considered an African success story, have improved stability by moving away from the Washington Consensus approach to governance.	我是中文句子
Politically, Rwanda is strong, disciplined, and organized, but it is not liberal.	我是中文句子
The landslide reelection of President Paul Kagame last year had more to do with power than democracy.	我是中文句子
Although Kagame remains popular, his government was criticized for stifling free speech and human rights in the run-up to the vote.	我是中文句子
We should be intellectually honest and call a spade a spade.	我是中文句子
Rwandans should not be ashamed to value economic and administrative strength more than fair elections.	我是中文句子
The question for other African states seeking to reform their governance models, then, is how much of Rwanda’s approach to emulate.	我是中文句子
Neither the Washington Consensus nor the Beijing Model has all the answers.	我是中文句子
Health Coverage Must Not Ignore Africa’s Elderly	我是中文句子
DAR ES SALAAM – My grandmother is 76, and my grandfather is 83.	我是中文句子
They have lived fruitful lives together, cultivating crops and grazing cattle in a remote village in the hills of southwest Uganda.	我是中文句子
But whenever I think of them, I am more in awe of their good health than their hard work.	我是中文句子
Then, because they were recently dropped from their health-insurance plan due to age, they must cough up more money to foot the bill for treatment.	我是中文句子
In other words, for my grandparents – and for many older Africans – a visit to the doctor is onerous, costly, and exceedingly rare.	我是中文句子
Access to health care is an obsession for experts in international development.	我是中文句子
And yet, most of the attention centered on mothers, newborns, and children; elderly populations in developing countries were largely ignored.	我是中文句子
Failure to address this omission would leave an increasing share of the population without access to affordable health care.	我是中文句子
If this trend continues, the number of Africans living past their 60th birthday will more than double by 2050.	我是中文句子
This is of course good news; longevity is a key indicator of human development.	我是中文句子
But Africa’s elder boom will be a disaster if living longer means living sicker because of inadequate health care.	我是中文句子
In Uganda, many rural health-care centers lack the personnel, supplies, and infrastructure to meet the needs of older patients.	我是中文句子
Small clinics typically refer their oldest patients to the closest big hospital, which is often many miles away.	我是中文句子
It’s hard to blame those who opt for the latter.	我是中文句子
Given the dangers of travel, it is no wonder that my grandparents are reluctant to seek medical care.	我是中文句子
Of course, the biggest obstacle to health care in Uganda – like everywhere else – is money.	我是中文句子
In 2015, researchers at Makerere University found that household income is the main determinant of elderly people’s access to and use of health-care services.	我是中文句子
The story is similar in the United States, where average annual health-care costs have been increasing for decades.	我是中文句子
Still, a dearth of dedicated resources does not mean that Africa’s leaders must ignore their older constituents.	我是中文句子
By combining elder-care services with existing programs, health benefits can be extended to underserved populations.	我是中文句子
For example, single-sector initiatives, like HIV/AIDS treatment schemes, could include elderly-friendly health-care components.	我是中文句子
Health-care workers who serve expectant and new mothers could also be trained to provide in-home care for the elderly in multigenerational households.	我是中文句子
These types of initiatives would not require vast sums of money; rather, the most important factor in launching them is political support and effective program integration.	我是中文句子
Developing countries have made considerable gains when it comes to improving health care for the young.	我是中文句子
Now, we must do the same for the elderly.	我是中文句子
In Uganda, the government’s national health-care strategy could easily be strengthened by adding seniors to the list of so-called vulnerable groups.	我是中文句子
Finally, community health-insurance schemes must be overhauled to prevent the exclusion of poor older patients.	我是中文句子
We all yearn to live long, healthy, productive lives – just as my grandparents have.	我是中文句子
But without lifelong access to quality health care, longevity will be more luck than science.	我是中文句子
The integrity of any society can be judged by how well it treats its youngest and oldest members.	我是中文句子
That calculus applies to governments, too.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Must-Do Decade	我是中文句子
VIENNA – Since 2000, Africa has recorded impressive rates of economic growth, owing largely to development assistance and a prolonged commodity boom.	我是中文句子
While the continent shows great diversity in the socioeconomic trajectories, growth rates have generally masked an underlying lack of structural transformation.	我是中文句子
Many African countries have yet to undergo the kind of transformation that is necessary for socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable development over the long term: namely, industrialization.	我是中文句子
In recent decades, some developing countries – mainly in Asia – have managed to industrialize.	我是中文句子
But, despite repeated attempts, African countries have not.	我是中文句子
In 2014, the Asia and Pacific region’s share of value added in global manufacturing was 44.6%, whereas Africa’s was just 1.6%.	我是中文句子
With South Africa as its only industrialized country, Sub-Saharan Africa is the least industrialized region in the world.	我是中文句子
One such challenge is population growth.	我是中文句子
More than half of the continent’s 1.2 billion people are under the age of 19, and almost one in five are between the ages of 15 and 24.	我是中文句子
Each year, 12 million new workers join the labor force, and they will need the tools and skills to ensure their future livelihoods.	我是中文句子
Industrialization is the key to helping Africa’s fast-growing population realize a demographic dividend.	我是中文句子
A related challenge is migration.	我是中文句子
Many of Africa’s most ambitious and entrepreneurially minded young people are joining others in migrating north.	我是中文句子
But no country, especially in Africa, can afford to lose so much talent and potential.	我是中文句子
Industrialization alone cannot resolve the migration crisis, but it can address one root cause, by creating jobs in the countries of origin.	我是中文句子
A third challenge is climate change, which weighs heavily on countries where agriculture is still the primary sector for employment.	我是中文句子
To confront the threat, Africa will need to develop and adopt green technologies, while channeling more investment into resource efficiency and clean energy.	我是中文句子
With the right investments, African countries can reduce the cost of delivering power to rural areas, and contribute to global efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.	我是中文句子
In short, Africa must industrialize, and it must do so in a socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable manner.	我是中文句子
As it happens, the United Nations General Assembly has declared 2016-2025 to be the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa.	我是中文句子
During IDDA III, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, which I lead, will spearhead the new approach to sustainable development sketched above.	我是中文句子
The program was launched in 2014, and is already being successfully implemented in two African countries – Ethiopia and Senegal – and in Peru.	我是中文句子
The PCP approach is designed to maximize the impact of all partner programs and projects that are relevant to industrial development.	我是中文句子
To that end, strategic partnerships with financial institutions and the business sector are particularly important.	我是中文句子
With these in place, African countries can marshal additional resources for infrastructure, innovation, expertise, and new technologies.	我是中文句子
UNIDO’s goal is to make the PCP model the mainstream approach for all African countries.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Decade of Industrialization	我是中文句子
VIENNA – In today’s interdependent global economy, Africa remains a weak link.	我是中文句子
Africa is by no means destined to lag behind the rest of the world economy.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, it could easily become a global economic powerhouse – and within the next decade.	我是中文句子
But, to fulfill its economic potential, Africa must industrialize.	我是中文句子
For the first time, the G20 placed industrialization in Africa – and all of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) – on its agenda.	我是中文句子
The African Union’s Agenda 2063 also supports this drive.	我是中文句子
The recent UN General Assembly resolution declaring 2016-2025 the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa is yet another push in this direction.	我是中文句子
All of these declarations and commitments are an important first step.	我是中文句子
The question is how.	我是中文句子
The short answer is money and action.	我是中文句子
We must challenge the international community and development partners to back their words with real financial commitments.	我是中文句子
And we must build partnerships to operationalize programs that will enable Africa to become the world’s next main engine of economic growth.	我是中文句子
Such programs must recognize and tackle the acute challenges the continent faces.	我是中文句子
The economic growth experienced in recent decades has not been structurally driven, sustainable, or fully inclusive.	我是中文句子
Indeed, growth rates vary widely across the continent, and not all Africans are benefiting.	我是中文句子
Though the middle class in Africa has expanded markedly in recent years, generating a consumer boom and boosting domestic investment, many people still struggle to make a living.	我是中文句子
Unemployment rates are high, especially for young people and women – a reality that drives many Africans to head north.	我是中文句子
To keep them home, Africa’s economies must move beyond producing raw materials to build dynamic and competitive manufacturing sectors with higher value added.	我是中文句子
Here, Africa must draw on the opportunities presented by participation in global and regional value chains.	我是中文句子
New and innovative industrial-development strategies, as well as carefully tailored measures to attract foreign direct investment, must be introduced.	我是中文句子
Of course, to develop such strategies and participate effectively in industrial value chains, Africans need knowledge.	我是中文句子
Investment in education and skills training is imperative to facilitate successful and lasting industrialization.	我是中文句子
Knowledge of other countries’ experiences will also help Africa to avoid the pitfalls of unbridled industrialization – particularly environmental damage.	我是中文句子
Africa must ensure that its industrial-development strategy includes effective environmental safeguards.	我是中文句子
Africa is well placed to industrialize.	我是中文句子
It also benefits from a highly educated diaspora.	我是中文句子
But industrialization is never automatic.	我是中文句子
Governments must step up to address market failures, while planning, implementing, and enforcing industrial policies that address the shortcomings of previous ineffective versions.	我是中文句子
They must then institutionalize these new policies in national and regional development strategies.	我是中文句子
To succeed, governments will need adequate capacity, competence, and legitimacy to mobilize and interact with all stakeholders, thereby creating an attractive investment climate.	我是中文句子
The necessary reforms will open the way for public-private partnerships, which can provide investment for infrastructure development and maintenance.	我是中文句子
A recent report, prepared for the Hangzhou G20 Summit, features a number of recommendations for Africa.	我是中文句子
Other recommendations relate to trade and regional integration, leveraging domestic and external finance, and promoting what it calls the “New Industrial Revolution.”	我是中文句子
My numerous meetings with African leaders and visits to dozens of countries across the continent have convinced me that Africa is committed to industrialization.	我是中文句子
In fact, the process is already underway in many countries, including Ethiopia, Ghana, Rwanda, and Senegal.	我是中文句子
By offering our commitment and support, we can enable these countries to realize inclusive and sustainable development for the benefit of everyone.	我是中文句子
A Roadmap for African Industrialization	我是中文句子
ABIDJAN – Africa is at a crossroads.	我是中文句子
Yet Africa’s economic growth has not been accompanied by a commensurate level of job creation, which has particularly negative implications for women and young people.	我是中文句子
In fact, today’s jobless growth could even reverse the gains made in eradicating poverty in recent years.	我是中文句子
The problem is that Africa’s growth, while impressive, has been volatile, because it has been driven mainly by high commodity prices, rather than by manufacturing.	我是中文句子
The economic effects of this imbalance should not be underestimated.	我是中文句子
Despite its vast natural resources, Africa will remain at the mercy of commodity prices and trade flows until it undertakes a profound structural transformation.	我是中文句子
The time has come for Africa to unlock its true economic potential by following in the footsteps of every modern economy and undertaking the transition from agriculture to manufacturing.	我是中文句子
Africa’s manufacturing sector is the weakest link in its ongoing integration into the global economy.	我是中文句子
Today, primary products (raw materials) comprise 62% of Africa’s total exports, the highest share in the world.	我是中文句子
Clearly, Africa must start catching up.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, there is already a global consensus that industrialization matters, and that it is in everyone’s interest for Africa to become the global manufacturing power it ought to be.	我是中文句子
With its “High 5 Agenda,” the African Development Bank (AfDB) has made industrialization a top priority.	我是中文句子
Likewise, industrialization is a key component of the African Union’s “Agenda 2063.”	我是中文句子
And, in 2016, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2016-2025 the “Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa.”	我是中文句子
But such pronouncements are meaningless in the absence of concrete action.	我是中文句子
To change the region’s economic trajectory, African policymakers must focus on three key areas: industrial policies, infrastructure financing, and leadership.	我是中文句子
We now know that industrial policies can be effective in boosting growth.	我是中文句子
The question is whether states possess the capacity to implement the policies they design.	我是中文句子
If they do, they can channel resources toward industry and marshal available technologies to create synergy between the agriculture and manufacturing sectors.	我是中文句子
A number of African countries have already moved in this direction.	我是中文句子
Ethiopia, for example, has created special economic zones, where it has lowered production costs by investing in infrastructure.	我是中文句子
As a result, the country has emerged as Africa’s largest hub for textile manufacturing, attracting major players like H&M and Primark.	我是中文句子
But industrialization cannot happen without power, roads, and railways, which is why infrastructure must be a key focus.	我是中文句子
As of now, the AfDB pegs Africa’s infrastructure gap at $130–170 billion per year.	我是中文句子
Closing it will require not just more financing, but also more innovative thinking, particularly concerning joint public-private efforts.	我是中文句子
To that end, the AfDB has expanded its portfolio for financing new infrastructure projects in several countries.	我是中文句子
African countries should make such investments now to reap the demographic dividend of the continent’s population bulge in the years ahead.	我是中文句子
No country has ever undergone economic modernization without industry.	我是中文句子
But, more to the point, no functional industrial sector has ever emerged in the absence of strong, committed leadership.	我是中文句子
Consider Mauritius, which in the 1970s was a low-income mono-crop economy with a per capita GDP of just under $250.	我是中文句子
Today, Mauritius is an upper-middle-income country with a more diversified economy and a per capita GDP of around $9,600.	我是中文句子
It is often cited as a model of economic success in Africa.	我是中文句子
How did this come about?	我是中文句子
As former Mauritian Prime Minister and President Anerood Jugnauth has put it, “There is no miracle.	我是中文句子
It is due simply to hard work, discipline, and will.”	我是中文句子
Leaders who want to develop a strong manufacturing base must have the political will to distribute resources fairly and pull the private sector along.	我是中文句子
Mauritius experienced its fair share of challenges in moving from low-end manufacturing to technology-intensive goods and services.	我是中文句子
But it now stands as an example of what committed leadership can accomplish.	我是中文句子
Other African countries would do well to emulate it as they pursue their own economic transformations.	我是中文句子
All told, Africa is well placed to seize many of the opportunities that the global economy offers emerging markets.	我是中文句子
It already has the resources and the labor; now it needs committed leaders like Jugnauth who will implement the right policies.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Alternative Path to Development	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – Recent projections indicate that several Sub-Saharan African countries will experience robust economic growth over the next five years.	我是中文句子
By 2023, around one-third of the region’s economies will have grown at an average annual rate of 5% or higher since 2000.	我是中文句子
And yet, as The Economist observed last year, Africa’s development model “puzzles economists.”	我是中文句子
After all, only four of the continent’s high-growth countries are natural-resource dependent.	我是中文句子
Nor is overall performance due primarily to industrialization, as traditional development models would have predicted.	我是中文句子
What, then, explains the strong economic performance?	我是中文句子
Africa owes this structural transformation not to traditional industries, but to new developments in tradable services and agro-industries that resemble traditional industrialization.	我是中文句子
Aside from horticulture and agro-business, these new industries include information and communication technology-based services (ICT) and tourism.	我是中文句子
This is a departure from the historical norm.	我是中文句子
But in Africa, manufacturing as a share of total economic activity has stagnated at around 10%, with economic activity moving from agriculture to services.	我是中文句子
And because the rate of productivity growth in services is only about half that of manufacturing, the aggregate productivity gains needed for sustained growth have fallen relatively short.	我是中文句子
This process of premature deindustrialization is not unique to Africa.	我是中文句子
But it is more consequential for the continent, given the scale of its development challenges.	我是中文句子
Owing to its young, rapidly growing labor force, Africa now needs to create more than 11 million jobs in the formal economy every year.	我是中文句子
In Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa, the ICT sector is flourishing.	我是中文句子
In Rwanda, tourism is now the single largest export activity, accounting for about 30% of total exports.	我是中文句子
As these smokestack-less industries have grown, they have generated new patterns of structural change that are distinct from those of East Asia’s manufacturing-led transformation.	我是中文句子
But, if properly stewarded, they could play the same role in Africa’s development as manufacturing did in East Asia.	我是中文句子
In addition to being tradable, they have higher productivity and can absorb large numbers of moderately skilled workers.	我是中文句子
And like manufacturing, they also benefit from technological change and economies of scale and agglomeration.	我是中文句子
Moreover, Africa’s smokestack-less service sectors have the added advantage of being less vulnerable to automation.	我是中文句子
Notwithstanding automation’s many benefits, it presents challenges for countries where the overriding priority is to create a sufficient number of formal-sector jobs.	我是中文句子
While economists have been increasingly confident that Africa’s development model will be different from that of East Asia, they have been less certain about what shape it will take.	我是中文句子
An industries-without-smokestacks model offers one possible answer.	我是中文句子
The development of industries without smokestacks can occur alongside efforts to develop those with smokestacks, thus offering a multifaceted approach for Africa to achieve structural transformation.	我是中文句子
Banking on African Infrastructure	我是中文句子
Of the available options, one specific asset class stands out: infrastructure.	我是中文句子
Africa, which by 2050 will be home to an estimated 2.6 billion people, is in dire need of funds to build and maintain roads, ports, power grids, and so on.	我是中文句子
Yet, if the recent past is any guide, the capital needed will be difficult to secure.	我是中文句子
Given this track record, how will Africa fund even a fraction of the World Bank’s projected requirements?	我是中文句子
The obvious source is institutional and foreign investment.	我是中文句子
Investment in African infrastructure is perceived as simply being too risky.	我是中文句子
Companies from the private sector are also profitably financing projects on the continent.	我是中文句子
But these are the exceptions, not the rule.	我是中文句子
Fully funding Africa’s infrastructure shortfall will require attracting many more investors – and swiftly.	我是中文句子
To succeed, Africa must develop a more coherent and coordinated approach to courting capital, while at the same time working to mitigate investors’ risk exposure.	我是中文句子
Public-private sector collaborations are one possibility.	我是中文句子
For example, in the energy sector, independent power producers are working with governments to provide electricity to 620 million Africans living off the grid.	我是中文句子
There are approximately 130 such producers in Sub-Saharan Africa, valued at more than $8 billion.	我是中文句子
In South Africa alone, 47 projects are underway, accounting for 7,000 megawatts of additional power production.	我是中文句子
Similar private-public partnerships are emerging in other sectors, too, such as transportation.	我是中文句子
Among the most promising are toll roads built with private money, a model that began in South Africa.	我是中文句子
Clearly, Africa needs more of these ventures to overcome its infrastructure challenges.	我是中文句子
That is why I, along with other African business leaders and policymakers, have called on Africa’s institutional investors to commit 5% of their funds to local infrastructure.	我是中文句子
One sector that could lead the way on this commitment is the continent’s pension funds, which, together, possess a balance sheet of about $3 trillion.	我是中文句子
The 5% Agenda campaign, launched in New York last month, underscores the belief that only a collaborative public-private approach can redress Africa’s infrastructure shortfall.	我是中文句子
For years, a lack of bankable projects deterred international financing.	我是中文句子
It was a solid start – one that the 5% Agenda seeks to build upon.	我是中文句子
But some key reforms will be needed.	我是中文句子
A high priority of the 5% Agenda is to assist in updating the national and regional regulatory frameworks that guide institutional investment in Africa.	我是中文句子
Similarly, new financial products must be developed to give asset owners the ability to allocate capital directly to infrastructure projects.	我是中文句子
Unlocking new pools of capital will help create jobs, encourage regional integration, and ensure that Africa has the facilities to accommodate the needs of future generations.	我是中文句子
But all of this depends on persuading investors to put their money into African projects.	我是中文句子
As business leaders and policymakers, we must ensure that the conditions for profitability and social impact are not mutually exclusive.	我是中文句子
When development goals and profits align, everyone wins.	我是中文句子
Freeing Africa’s Internet	我是中文句子
Since 2012, this small group of journalists-turned-online activists has used social media to campaign for political freedoms and civil liberties in their country.	我是中文句子
Ethiopia’s government is not alone in seeking to consolidate political power by restricting what citizens say online.	我是中文句子
Across Africa, governments are enacting legislation to restrict Internet access and outlaw criticism of elected officials.	我是中文句子
Digital campaigners face myriad censorship tactics, including “Border Gateway Protocol” attacks, “HTTP throttling,” and “deep packet inspections.”	我是中文句子
The irony, of course, is that censorship rarely quiets the disaffected.	我是中文句子
At the moment, however, few of Africa’s leaders are listening.	我是中文句子
Leaders in nine of the 18 African countries that held elections in 2016 placed some level of restriction on the Internet to limit dissent.	我是中文句子
Four days prior to Uganda’s presidential vote in February, President Yoweri Museveni cut access to mobile payment services and social media sites.	我是中文句子
In August and September, Gabon’s president, Ali Bongo, seeking to project an atmosphere of calm to the international community, shut down Internet access overnight.	我是中文句子
Then in December, officials in Democratic Republic of the Congo ordered an Internet shutdown the day before President Joseph Kabila was scheduled to leave office, thereby quashing online dissent when he refused to step down.	我是中文句子
Internet blackouts like these violate people’s human rights and undermine democratic processes.	我是中文句子
Most African governments try to justify Internet embargoes by arguing that the restrictions are necessary to ensure public safety and security.	我是中文句子
Museveni, for example, claimed that blocking Internet access was the only way to protect visiting heads of state during his swearing-in ceremony.	我是中文句子
But he presented no evidence linking social media accessibility and security in Uganda, or anywhere else.	我是中文句子
With several key African elections coming up, Internet shutdowns are again on the horizon.	我是中文句子
For decades, Mugabe has relied on intimidation and violence to stifle political dissent.	我是中文句子
It is not surprising, then, that he has already begun taking a hostile approach to online activism.	我是中文句子
But citizens are not helpless.	我是中文句子
While governments issue orders to cut off Internet access, only telecommunications companies have the ability to hit the “kill switch.”	我是中文句子
Moreover, civil-society groups, the African Union, and the UN should do more to condemn national legislation that aims to normalize restrictive Internet policies.	我是中文句子
Finally, new continent-wide measures are needed to ensure that Africans’ online rights are recognized and respected by their governments.	我是中文句子
Such interventions are needed now more than ever.	我是中文句子
The Kenyan, Zimbabwean, and Ethiopian legislatures are currently considering laws that would permit significantly greater government control over Internet access.	我是中文句子
Last year, Tanzania adopted legislation that has already been used to charge individuals with crimes who have criticized President John Magufuli on social media.	我是中文句子
Whether governments bar citizens from gathering in public, signing petitions, or accessing the Internet and posting on social media makes no difference.	我是中文句子
All such measures are designed to strip citizens of their rights.	我是中文句子
The battle for freedom, as Zone 9 has shown, is no less real when the public square is the digital domain.	我是中文句子
Capturing Africa’s High Returns	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – Since 2000, at least half of the world’s fastest-growing economies have been in Africa.	我是中文句子
And by 2030, Africa will be home to 1.7 billion people, whose combined consumer and business spending will total $6.7 trillion.	我是中文句子
Seven years ago, the Harvard Business Review pointed out that Africa is also home to many of the world’s biggest opportunities.	我是中文句子
And yet, despite its tremendous business potential, Africa has not risen to the top of Western business leaders’ agendas.	我是中文句子
In fact, between 2014 and 2016, US exports to Africa fell by almost half, from $38 billion to $22 billion.	我是中文句子
If Western businesses hope to keep up, they will need to tap into the African countries and sectors with the highest potential for growth.	我是中文句子
By 2030, household consumption is expected to reach $2.5 trillion, up from $1.1 trillion in 2015.	我是中文句子
But there will also be lucrative opportunities in Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia.	我是中文句子
Any one of these countries would be a good bet for companies seeking to enter new markets.	我是中文句子
For its part, the African Development Bank can help investors find promising projects through its Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa.	我是中文句子
The expected growth in agriculture and agricultural processing reflects the fact that food and beverages will constitute the largest share of total household spending.	我是中文句子
Moreover, 60% of the world’s unused arable land is in Africa, which still contributes a meager share of worldwide agricultural exports.	我是中文句子
That means there is a lot of room for growth.	我是中文句子
In addition, Angola, Morocco, and South Africa now all have sizable markets, and have committed to expanding their agricultural sectors.	我是中文句子
According to the Harvard Business Review, Africa also has the potential to become “the world’s next great manufacturing center.”	我是中文句子
This helps to explain why manufacturing will be the second-largest sector in terms of business-to-business spending.	我是中文句子
South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria are already becoming promising places to invest in these areas.	我是中文句子
And investors will also be able to find high returns and favorable business environments in Ethiopia, Morocco, and Rwanda.	我是中文句子
Africa is the world’s last frontier market, and Western businesses need to start taking advantage of its tremendous potential, as Chinese firms already are.	我是中文句子
Doing business in Africa will also create sustainable jobs and advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to eliminate poverty and hunger.	我是中文句子
And that, too, will be good for the bottom line.	我是中文句子
Strengthening African Science	我是中文句子
And yet most African governments are failing to fund research and development adequately in their countries.	我是中文句子
According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa spend, on average, just 0.5% of GDP on research and development.	我是中文句子
In the West, the share is closer to 3%.	我是中文句子
This disparity underscores the development challenges that Africans face.	我是中文句子
Africa is home to 15% of the world’s population and 5% of its GDP, but accounts for a paltry 1.3% of total research spending.	我是中文句子
To be sure, these trends are not universal; some African governments are investing heavily in science-led innovation.	我是中文句子
In South Africa, for example, authorities have pledged to double R&D spending by 2020 – to 1.5% of GDP.	我是中文句子
This follows a 2016 commitment by African heads of state to increase science and technology budgets to at least 1% of GDP by 2025.	我是中文句子
A handful of countries – including Kenya, Rwanda, and Senegal – are working hard to reach this funding threshold.	我是中文句子
Africa also benefits from generous research-related aid and international support.	我是中文句子
One of the top donors, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has invested more than $450 million in African science initiatives over the last decade.	我是中文句子
Projects include a $306 million program to boost crop yields and a $62.5 million grant to improve health outcomes.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, many African governments lack the resources to fund programs that could build on these gains.	我是中文句子
Simply put, a new, more collaborative approach to African science is urgently needed.	我是中文句子
Africa’s leaders have pooled their science resources before.	我是中文句子
It was an ambitious goal that yielded early results.	我是中文句子
Between 2005 and 2014, continent-wide spending on R&D increased, while research output more than doubled in many countries.	我是中文句子
Since then, however, progress has stalled.	我是中文句子
But summits are only part of the solution; governments must also commit to improving research quality, and they can start by focusing attention on three key areas.	我是中文句子
First, Africa’s leaders must engage with CEOs, philanthropists, and donors who understand the long-term value of investing in science.	我是中文句子
Innovation is expensive, and seed money will be needed to help strengthen the continent’s scientific capacity.	我是中文句子
Second, African universities and institutions should align their research agendas with national and regional goals.	我是中文句子
For example, given that one of Africa’s most pressing challenges is feeding its growing population, schools specializing in agricultural research should ensure that their work contributes to solutions.	我是中文句子
Last but not least, countries should encourage entrepreneurship within research organizations.	我是中文句子
One way to do this is by establishing commercialization offices, which could help scientists bring their research to market.	我是中文句子
To overcome Africa’s human development challenges, African governments must invest in the people who can overcome them.	我是中文句子
The High Cost of Food Monopolies in Africa	我是中文句子
LAGOS – In May, global food prices increased 1.2%, reaching their highest level since October 2017.	我是中文句子
This upward trajectory is having a disproportionate impact in Africa, where the share of household income spent on food is also rising.	我是中文句子
To ensure food security, governments must work quickly to reverse these trends, and one place to start is by policing the producers who are feeding the frenzy.	我是中文句子
According to data compiled by the World Economic Forum, four of the world’s top five countries in terms of food expenditure are in Africa.	我是中文句子
One reason for the distortion is the price of food relative to income.	我是中文句子
As Africa urbanizes, people are buying more imported semi- or fully processed foods, which cost more than locally produced foods.	我是中文句子
And in most countries, wages have not kept pace with inflation.	我是中文句子
In turn, prices for most commodities have risen.	我是中文句子
These prices hit consumers both directly and indirectly (owing to pass-through of higher input costs by food conglomerates and service providers).	我是中文句子
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has long argued that food security and fair pricing depends on markets that are free from monopolistic tendencies.	我是中文句子
And yet, in many African countries, this advice has rarely been heeded.	我是中文句子
To be sure, this is not a new problem.	我是中文句子
And, despite the considerable attention such cases have received, the underlying problems persist.	我是中文句子
According to the World Bank, more than 70% of African countries rank in the bottom half globally for efforts to protect “market-based competition.”	我是中文句子
While 27 African countries and five regional blocs do have antitrust laws on the books, enforcement is rare.	我是中文句子
The remaining countries have no regulations at all and have made little progress in drafting them.	我是中文句子
There is one notable exception: South Africa.	我是中文句子
Since 1998, the country’s Competition Act has prohibited any company controlling at least 45% of the market from excluding other firms or seeking to exercise control over pricing.	我是中文句子
Other countries should follow South Africa’s lead.	我是中文句子
Companies and special-interest groups will always seek to benefit from the absence of regulation.	我是中文句子
The need for reform is greatest in countries like Nigeria and Ghana, where food expenditures are high and food-industry pressure is most pronounced.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, there is growing recognition of the need to address these challenges.	我是中文句子
Unregulated markets in competition context constitute the otherwise ‘legitimate’ vehicle for both financial and social extortion.”	我是中文句子
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of political leaders to protect consumers from collusion and price-fixing.	我是中文句子
There is no question that Africa’s businesses need space to innovate and grow, but their success should never come at the cost of someone else’s next meal.	我是中文句子
The Cancer Threat to Africa’s Future	我是中文句子
Every year, some 650,000 Africans are diagnosed with cancer, and more than a half-million die from the disease.	我是中文句子
Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, tremendous progress has been made in combating deadly infectious diseases.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, similar gains have not been made in the fight against non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer.	我是中文句子
Today, cancer kills more people in developing countries than AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined.	我是中文句子
But, with Africa receiving only 5% of global funding for cancer prevention and control, the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it.	我是中文句子
Just as the world united to help Africa beat infectious disease outbreaks, a similar collaborative approach is needed to halt the cancer crisis.	我是中文句子
Surviving cancer requires many things, but timely access to specialists, laboratories, and second opinions are among the most basic.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, Africa already has a head start.	我是中文句子
National efforts are also strengthening pharmaceutical supply chains, improving medical training, and increasing the quality of diagnostic networks.	我是中文句子
Still, Africans cannot face down this threat alone.	我是中文句子
That is why the American Society for Clinical Pathology, where I work, is cooperating with other global health-care innovators to attack the region’s growing cancer crisis.	我是中文句子
To complement these technical efforts, the ACS is also training African health-care professionals how to carry out biopsies and deliver chemotherapy.	我是中文句子
That initiative, funded by Novartis, is viewed as a pilot program that could expand to other regional countries.	我是中文句子
These initiatives are in conjunction with other undertakings, such as a joint ACS-Clinton Health Access Initiative program to broaden access to cancer medications.	我是中文句子
Today, a similar global effort is needed to ensure that every African with a cancer diagnosis can get the treatment they need.	我是中文句子
But geography should never be the deciding factor in patients’ fight to survive the disease.	我是中文句子
Cancer has been Africa’s silent killer for far too long, and the global health community must no longer remain quiet in the face of this crisis.	我是中文句子
Investing in Africa’s Educators	我是中文句子
Those who work in the education sector on the continent have to seek solutions that are faster, cheaper, and can be scaled up.	我是中文句子
Too often, though, expedient approaches prove shortsighted, and fail to engage local leaders who hold the keys to economic and social progress.	我是中文句子
Too often, grassroots-level voices, reflecting firsthand experience addressing their communities’ problems, are ignored.	我是中文句子
When global leaders gather in Hamburg this week for the G20 summit, the new G20-Africa Partnership will take center stage.	我是中文句子
But those committed to helping Africa should focus squarely on the nuts and bolts of aid and development – and that means investing in local leadership.	我是中文句子
Sadly, the best-funded aid organizations in Africa are often run by Westerners, or by Africans who have extensive ties to the West.	我是中文句子
This financial prejudice is visible elsewhere, too, and it is perpetuating the dearth of local talent.	我是中文句子
The pro-Western bias should worry everyone working to build better communities for our children.	我是中文句子
What would it look like if the leaders overhauling such systems were cultivated from the very communities that needed them most?	我是中文句子
Some organizations are answering that question already.	我是中文句子
We call this powerful grouping of change-agents “collective leadership,” and we believe it is the only way to ensure positive, lasting change.	我是中文句子
The second is the failure to invest in children.	我是中文句子
In Uganda, 70% of children do not complete primary school.	我是中文句子
Basic education is the foundation for our lifelong ability to analyze information, present ideas and opinions, and challenge the world around us.	我是中文句子
And yet, in too many African communities, we are failing to invest in laying those foundations.	我是中文句子
Imagine what could be accomplished if efforts to place local recruits in low-income schools were expanded.	我是中文句子
A robust job market presupposes a sufficient number of skilled workers to fill available jobs.	我是中文句子
But in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 58% of children complete primary school.	我是中文句子
This is why, when G20 leaders discuss new economic development strategies for Africa, they should focus on investment in education.	我是中文句子
But, more important, they should seek to ensure that resources make it to those who rely on local leadership and innovation.	我是中文句子
Empowering the Other Half of Africa’s Economy	我是中文句子
But, two decades later, Africa remains divided along a key fault line: gender.	我是中文句子
Unleashing the employment potential of African women is the best way to overcome it.	我是中文句子
As it stands, Africa’s women continue to be underrepresented in key industries and executive roles, owing to workplace discrimination and patriarchal expectations at home.	我是中文句子
But while women are essential to the continent’s progress, they are still too often regarded as being secondary.	我是中文句子
Studies have shown that if more women had access to male-dominated occupations in Africa, worker productivity would rise by as much as 25%.	我是中文句子
That would be good for the overall economy, but also for women in general, as it would open up new avenues for social empowerment.	我是中文句子
When women participate in the job market and engage actively in business or political decision-making, patriarchal power dynamics shift, elevating the social status of women.	我是中文句子
Economic equality also challenges accepted beliefs, and dispels harmful myths that perpetuate narrow definitions of gender norms.	我是中文句子
In other words, bringing more women into the workplace leads to an emancipation of mindset – in men and women alike.	我是中文句子
What Nyerere so eloquently said of Africa as a whole is no less true for its women: unity is the key to realizing our potential.	我是中文句子
Divided, we are weak, but together, Africa’s women have the ability to confront and overcome the barriers that have kept us from full participation in our respective economies.	我是中文句子
There is power in networks.	我是中文句子
We aim to emerge from the Forum with a common agenda for our participation as full economic actors.	我是中文句子
It has been just over 20 years since Nyerere encouraged us to work toward African unity.	我是中文句子
Today, Africa’s women are helping to shape the policies and practices that will bring about economic and social liberation in their respective countries.	我是中文句子
We have some way to go before African unity is fully realized.	我是中文句子
But enabling women to become full partners in Africa’s economic future, is among the best ways to ensure that we succeed.	我是中文句子
Capitalizing on Africa’s Youth Dividend	我是中文句子
It was a pivotal moment in South Africa’s history, as young people rose to demand quality and accessible education.	我是中文句子
For Africa, the question is no longer “if” students are taught, but “what.”	我是中文句子
Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programs have also suffered from neglect.	我是中文句子
Today, these initiatives are marked by outdated courses and rote learning methods that fail to prepare young people for the demands of the twenty-first-century job market.	我是中文句子
Though neglected, it is these skills that enable young people to become adaptable, lifelong learners.	我是中文句子
The mastery of soft skills correlates to improved outcomes in school, work, and life.	我是中文句子
Yet, until recently, training in soft skills has not been integrated into formal education systems on the continent.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, that is changing.	我是中文句子
These adjustments are coming at a critical time for Africa, where many countries are experiencing a demographic dividend of declining fertility rates and rising productivity.	我是中文句子
In particular, these changes mean more opportunity for young people as they prepare to enter the job market.	我是中文句子
But to succeed on the job, young people must have the skills and education that a modern economy requires.	我是中文句子
The focus on personal development, interpersonal communication, and leadership training has ensured that students are well equipped to enter the labor market upon graduation.	我是中文句子
Rwanda’s Ministry of Education has already moved to integrate elements of the program in TVETs across the country.	我是中文句子
National exams in the 2018-2019 academic year will also reflect the new competency-based curriculum.	我是中文句子
Case studies from Skills at Scale highlight six components to a successful skills-training initiative.	我是中文句子
Change is not without challenge.	我是中文句子
Adapting models of skills training to vastly different education systems across Africa will take time.	我是中文句子
It will also be difficult to ensure that intensive training models reach all young people, including those no longer in school.	我是中文句子
New curriculum content also requires developing new teaching and learning materials.	我是中文句子
Achieving scale also requires a markedly different approach to training teachers than is currently on offer in most African school systems.	我是中文句子
Trainings must go beyond traditional, one-off approaches, by providing ongoing teacher support.	我是中文句子
New pedagogies also require continual supervision and practice, especially early on.	我是中文句子
The old “cascade” model of teacher training simply won’t work.	我是中文句子
African governments, with support from the international community, can help students’ transition from school to work by relying on a curriculum that elevates the importance of soft skills.	我是中文句子
If done well, these changes can ensure young people are positioned to drive Africa’s future prosperity.	我是中文句子
Africans deserve a forward-looking education system, not one that remains stuck in the past.	我是中文句子
As students in South Africa demonstrated last year, the continent’s youth will settle for nothing less.	我是中文句子
A Big Bond for Africa	我是中文句子
LAGOS – The countries of Sub-Saharan Africa have reached a critical juncture.	我是中文句子
The estimated growth rate for 2016 is lower than the population growth rate of about 2%, implying a per capita contraction in GDP.	我是中文句子
Sustained economic growth is essential to maintain progress on reducing poverty, infant mortality, disease, and malnutrition.	我是中文句子
One way to sustain growth and create jobs would be to collaborate on planning and implementing a massive increase in infrastructure investment across Africa.	我是中文句子
Public infrastructure is particularly important.	我是中文句子
Major regional projects are also needed to knit together Sub-Saharan Africa’s many tiny economies.	我是中文句子
Yet aid from Africa’s traditionally generous foreign donors, including the United States and Europe, is now set to shrink, owing to political and economic constraints.	我是中文句子
But there may be a solution that helps Africa recover its growth in a way that Western leaders and their constituents find acceptable.	我是中文句子
We call it the “Big Bond” – a strategy for leveraging foreign aid funds in international capital markets to generate financing for massive infrastructure investment.	我是中文句子
Specifically, donors would borrow against future aid flows in capital markets.	我是中文句子
That way, they could exploit current low interest rates at home, as they generate new resources.	我是中文句子
With 30-year US Treasury rates of about 3%, donors would have to securitize only about $5 billion to raise $100 billion.	我是中文句子
That money could come from the $35 billion in annual official development assistance (ODA) to Africa (which totals about $50 billion) that takes the form of pure grants.	我是中文句子
Donors would pass on the interest cost to African countries, reducing their own fiscal costs.	我是中文句子
For African countries, the terms would be better than those provided by Eurobonds.	我是中文句子
In fact, as audacious as it may sound, passing on the interest costs to recipient countries could actually bolster their debt sustainability.	我是中文句子
Moreover, far longer maturities and grace periods, compared to market finance, would ease growing pressure on foreign-exchange reserves.	我是中文句子
Frontloading aid in this way is not new.	我是中文句子
Doing so in the early 2000s to finance vaccines saved millions of lives in the developing world.	我是中文句子
Such projects could also be co-financed by private investors.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the Big Bond could help to reinvigorate the relationship between donors and African countries.	我是中文句子
At a time when aid is under political pressure, perhaps such a bold approach to maximizing the efficiency of donor resources is exactly what the world needs.	我是中文句子
Accelerating Africa’s Energy Transition	我是中文句子
PARIS – For much of Africa, the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy is seen as an environmental imperative.	我是中文句子
With fossil fuels comprising a majority – as high as 70% in some cases – of the energy mix, the situation on the continent is indeed ecologically dire.	我是中文句子
But Africa’s energy transition is economically urgent as well.	我是中文句子
Each year, oil subsidies consume 1.5% of the continent’s GDP – roughly $50 billion.	我是中文句子
That is enough money to provide solar power to some 300 million people.	我是中文句子
Today, neither oil exporters nor importers are adequately insulated from price shocks.	我是中文句子
When oil prices declined rapidly in 2015, for example, Africa’s energy importers spent less on oil, while exporting countries suffered financially.	我是中文句子
When prices rebounded, the relationship switched: energy-exporting countries’ revenues inched up, while importing countries struggled to maintain consumption levels.	我是中文句子
This is a needless cycle.	我是中文句子
Integrating cleaner power into national energy systems would not only raise local capacities; it would also free up hydrocarbons for export.	我是中文句子
The resulting revenue could then be invested into new forms of greener power.	我是中文句子
Such a transition, which would require cooperation with the oil sector, promises to boost socioeconomic progress.	我是中文句子
Among the biggest benefits would be the electrification of areas that, under current distribution systems, are literally in the dark.	我是中文句子
Today, just 30% of Africa has access to reliable electricity.	我是中文句子
But, with a total capacity estimated at around ten terawatts, installed solar capacity in Africa could broaden access dramatically.	我是中文句子
In fact, according to some estimates, the increase in solar generation by 2030 could range from 15 to 62 gigawatts.	我是中文句子
Electrifying agricultural areas would facilitate the storage and transportation of farmed products, improve food security, and increase farmers’ earning capacity.	我是中文句子
In the drive to rebalance Africa’s energy mix, the continent maintains one crucial advantage over developed economies: a clean slate.	我是中文句子
The relative absence of legacy investments is the principal reason why green power is Africa’s best energy option.	我是中文句子
Evidence of this potential can be found in the few photovoltaic power plants that have begun operating in Africa.	我是中文句子
For example, the Senergy 2 solar plant in Senegal sells electricity to the Senegalese power utility at a price that lowers the cost of the energy mix by 50%.	我是中文句子
Similar solar solutions are being implemented by African telecoms to electrify communication towers.	我是中文句子
The best way to accelerate the transition from hydrocarbons to greener forms of energy would be to redirect a portion of national oil subsidies to renewables.	我是中文句子
This would create stronger incentives to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, while encouraging investment and growth in green-energy output.	我是中文句子
For Africa’s rural regions, moreover, such policies would help bring communities out of darkness and lead to the installation of other critical infrastructure that economic growth requires.	我是中文句子
But while renewables hold the key to Africa’s long-term prosperity, the continent’s transition to cleaner power should not lead to an immediate, full-scale repudiation of hydrocarbons.	我是中文句子
The oil sector will still have an important role to play.	我是中文句子
The industry’s experience on the continent will be needed to navigate the energy transformation.	我是中文句子
And, because fossil fuels will remain part of the continent’s energy mix, the oil sector must be encouraged to clean up its own act.	我是中文句子
This may sound like an impossible alliance.	我是中文句子
Cooperation between old and new energy industries may be the only engine that is capable of powering Africa forward.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Vaccination Test	我是中文句子
Fulfilling that commitment will be no easy feat.	我是中文句子
Immunization is not just a health issue; it is also an economic challenge.	我是中文句子
The case for vaccination is strong.	我是中文句子
Globally, an estimated 2-3 million child deaths and 600,000 adult deaths are prevented annually through immunization.	我是中文句子
Moreover, immunization is considered one of the most cost-effective public-health interventions for reducing child morbidity, mortality, and disability.	我是中文句子
A recent study estimates that every dollar spent on vaccination will save $16 in costs of illnesses averted.	我是中文句子
Accounting for the value individuals place on longer and healthier lives, net returns on investments in immunization soar to some 44 times the cost.	我是中文句子
And net returns exceed costs for all vaccines.	我是中文句子
Significant progress has been made.	我是中文句子
In 2014, 86% of children were immunized against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, compared to less than 5% in 1974.	我是中文句子
And there have been extraordinary advances in the number and kinds of vaccines that are available.	我是中文句子
Yet, worldwide, an estimated 18.7 million infants are not being reached by routine immunization services.	我是中文句子
The problem, of course, is access.	我是中文句子
Detailed analysis of immunization reveals significant disparities within and across countries.	我是中文句子
Routine immunization coverage remains particularly low in Africa; indeed, it has stagnated over the last three years, against a backdrop of weak and under-resourced health systems.	我是中文句子
As a result, one in five African children still do not receive lifesaving vaccination.	我是中文句子
In 2014, an estimated 42% of all global deaths from measles were in Africa.	我是中文句子
Most of Africa’s under-immunized children live in Nigeria, Ethiopia, the DRC, South Sudan, and Guinea.	我是中文句子
Poor people, those living in rural areas, and families with lower education levels comprise the majority of those who are not reached.	我是中文句子
Clearly, money is a leading factor shaping immunization outcomes.	我是中文句子
New vaccines should be enabling us to save more lives.	我是中文句子
Another study showed that in 2001, the total cost of the original set of six World Health Organization-recommended vaccines was less than one dollar.	我是中文句子
In 2014, the number of WHO-recommended vaccines had risen to 11 – and the cost had reached about $21 for boys and $35 for girls.	我是中文句子
That same study found that, in many low- and middle-income countries, immunization budgets are currently insufficient to sustain vaccination programs, much less incorporate the new costlier vaccines.	我是中文句子
Without eligibility for the lower prices obtained by Gavi, many of these countries may not be able to afford newer vaccines.	我是中文句子
In order to cope with this challenge, African political leaders have committed to invest in the continent’s capacity to develop and produce its own vaccines.	我是中文句子
But this is a long-term strategy that will require coordinated regional investment planning, market development, and stronger regulatory capabilities.	我是中文句子
In the short to medium term, African countries would do well to look into the power of collective bargaining to strike better deals for needed vaccines.	我是中文句子
While Africa can and should do more to improve vaccination, the global community also has a responsibility to make a concerted effort to bring down vaccine costs.	我是中文句子
The recently announced reduction in the price of pneumococcal vaccine is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	我是中文句子
Without collective action, equitable and sustained access to immunization in Africa will remain a major problem – and children’s lives will continue to be lost.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Avoidable AIDS Crisis	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – At Uganda’s largest AIDS clinic, I recently witnessed a remarkable celebration of life. The performers were a troupe of young African singers, drummers and dancers, ranging in age from roughly eight to 28.	我是中文句子
“Where beautiful people	我是中文句子
Laugh and dance in harmony.	我是中文句子
Africa.	我是中文句子
O Africa.”	我是中文句子
Listening, it was hard to imagine that they could easily be dead – and would be, if not for this clinic.	我是中文句子
Each of those splendid performers is living with HIV.	我是中文句子
Some arrived at the clinic so ill that they could scarcely walk.	我是中文句子
Others showed few symptoms but, having tested positive, came to be treated.	我是中文句子
They were mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, children and grandparents.	我是中文句子
All were alive and healthy for one reason only: the Joint Clinical Research Center in Kampala, and the drugs that it provides them.	我是中文句子
Yet Uganda is also a success story.	我是中文句子
A decade ago, fewer than 10,000 people were taking the new generation of antiretroviral drugs that suppress the disease and offer the promise of a normal life.	我是中文句子
We have seen similarly encouraging progress elsewhere.	我是中文句子
South Africa, with the largest number of people living with HIV, has spent nearly $1 billion over the past year in an ambitious counseling and testing campaign to roll back the epidemic.	我是中文句子
But there is a new and growing danger that these advances might not be sustained.	我是中文句子
In Uganda, only about half of those with HIV/AIDS are being treated.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, money for treatment is drying up.	我是中文句子
Because of the global recession, some international donors are threatening to cap their financial support.	我是中文句子
Countries such as Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, as well as Uganda, are requesting assistance for emergency drug supplies.	我是中文句子
In Kampala, Dr. Mugyenyi has begun placing new patients on a waiting list.	我是中文句子
As many as seven million Africans who should be getting treatment for HIV are not.	我是中文句子
Worldwide, the number is about 10 million.	我是中文句子
Compounding the problem: donors have also been shifting their focus from AIDS to other diseases, because there is a sense that more lives can be saved more cheaply.	我是中文句子
At a time when we should be scaling up to meet the AIDS challenge, we are dialing back.	我是中文句子
In our global war on AIDS, the international community is on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.	我是中文句子
Those who rallied to the fight are alarmed. They fear that the impressive gains of the last decade will be lost.	我是中文句子
“We are sitting on a time bomb,” Dr. Mugyenyi told me.	我是中文句子
Every day, he is forced into moral choices that no one should have to make.	我是中文句子
How do you choose to treat a young girl but not her little brother?	我是中文句子
How do you turn away a pregnant mother, sitting with her children, crying for help?	我是中文句子
Surely we can do better.	我是中文句子
In Kampala, I promised my young friends that I would do everything I could to help.	我是中文句子
In Washington recently, the United Nations rolled out an action plan that should dramatically accelerate progress on maternal and child health, including HIV.	我是中文句子
I left Uganda with a snatch of song that still echoes within my heart.	我是中文句子
Its inherent truth would be obvious, had you been there to see:	我是中文句子
We are still useful.	我是中文句子
To our countries, to our families.	我是中文句子
All we need is a way to live our days,	我是中文句子
All we need is to survive in Africa.	我是中文句子
Yes, times are hard.	我是中文句子
That is all the more reason to act out of compassion and with generosity.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Diaspora to the Rescue	我是中文句子
But there is another, woefully under-reported, side to the story.	我是中文句子
African countries that were locked out of international capital markets for most of the past five decades have largely been spared the twin woes of financial turmoil and economic downturn.	我是中文句子
The continent’s economies experienced a slowdown, but not a recession.	我是中文句子
Moreover, several African countries have received ratings from credit agencies, which has opened up global financial centers to them.	我是中文句子
In some cases, these ratings have proved equivalent to or higher than those of countries such as Turkey or Argentina.	我是中文句子
Stock exchanges are being established across the continent.	我是中文句子
These developments have combined to improve African countries’ macroeconomic performance dramatically.	我是中文句子
Inflation has been halved since the 1990’s, and foreign-exchange reserves have increased 30%.	我是中文句子
Since 2000, sub-Saharan African countries have achieved economic growth of 5-7%.	我是中文句子
Many factors have contributed to this upturn.	我是中文句子
Emerging-market demand has pushed up commodity prices.	我是中文句子
Urbanization has given rise to a dynamic informal sector.	我是中文句子
But transfers from the African diaspora stand out as the most significant contributing factor.	我是中文句子
In this respect, there are three different strategies in place in Africa.	我是中文句子
This approach, also adopted by Italy, contributes to reducing costs and increasing the overall volume of funds for beneficiaries.	我是中文句子
Finally, the Francophone approach relies on two types of monopoly.	我是中文句子
The first is enjoyed by Western Union, which controls up to 90% of the total formal transfer volume within Africa’s 16-member Franc Zone.	我是中文句子
The second monopoly is exercised in the banking sector.	我是中文句子
All other local banks have adopted the same approach, severely restricting access to financial services for households and entrepreneurs.	我是中文句子
Despite the increasing importance of remittances from Italy, Spain, and the United States, the largest share in absolute terms still originates from France.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Dictator-Diplomat	我是中文句子
Ethiopia’s government had strenuously denied rumors of serious ill health caused by liver cancer.	我是中文句子
Meles was certainly both.	我是中文句子
But, when the Cold War ended, so, too, did his dogmatism.	我是中文句子
Perhaps more important than Meles’s domestic achievements was his diplomatic record.	我是中文句子
At the same time, Meles courted China as both an investor and as a hedge against the West’s criticism of his human-rights record.	我是中文句子
The great stain on Meles’s record will always be his intolerance of dissent.	我是中文句子
To be sure, his human-rights record was far better than the Derg’s.	我是中文句子
For example, he allowed a private press to flourish, and in 2000 he became the first Ethiopian leader to hold multi-party parliamentary elections.	我是中文句子
Nor was there much evidence of personal enrichment or widespread corruption.	我是中文句子
At the same time, he imposed increasingly strict central control on his ethnically and linguistically diverse country.	我是中文句子
Although he strengthened religious freedom and peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians, the human-rights situation in Ethiopia remained poor.	我是中文句子
For example, groups like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch have documented widespread official repression of the Oromo people.	我是中文句子
In the Horn of Africa, there is no leader of his stature who could ensure the stability and strong governance that the region so desperately needs.	我是中文句子
Hailemariam Desalegn, Meles’s foreign minister, will take over Ethiopia’s government.	我是中文句子
For his admirers and critics alike, Meles leaves behind a potent political legacy.	我是中文句子
He will be remembered as an African leader of major historical significance: visionary, despotic, and indispensable.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Economic House Divided	我是中文句子
DAKAR – The world economic downturn and financial-market tremors have strained budgets across Africa.	我是中文句子
With the exception of Ghana, and a few other states, in 2009 most African countries’ fiscal balances deteriorated.	我是中文句子
Moreover, several African countries continued to implement long-term reforms to improve their business and investment climate, despite the daunting challenges presented by the crisis.	我是中文句子
But it is the dichotomized nature of their economies and finances that represents Africa’s most intractable structural imbalance.	我是中文句子
Frankly, two Africa’s are emerging: a modern economy and a cash-based economy.	我是中文句子
National payment systems operate electronic-based payment products and services.	我是中文句子
Banks are provided with a facility to monitor their positions in real time and hence make cost-effective investment decisions.	我是中文句子
So far, only a few registered financial institutions, primarily offshoots of Western commercial banks, have access to such payment-system facilities.	我是中文句子
Non-banking financial institutions such as foreign exchange bureaus, post offices, and micro-finance lenders are not admitted, even when they are financially sound and sustainable.	我是中文句子
Yet rapid urbanization everywhere in Africa has given rise to a dynamic informal sector unconnected to the modern economy.	我是中文句子
Although marginalized by African officials, this cash-based economy is a major contributor to the continent’s productive capacity.	我是中文句子
It employs more than 90% of the workforce and is home to 75% of the retailers.	我是中文句子
But, despite the pivotal economic role that the informal sector plays, it has no access to conventional bank loans.	我是中文句子
Micro-finance institutions provide the only credit lines open to informal operators.	我是中文句子
Nigeria has refrained from signing any exclusive agreements with Western Union and others, and its newly consolidated banking industry is making significant inroads across the region.	我是中文句子
Rwanda, too, has enacted regulations that eliminate exclusive agreements, opening doors for micro-finance institutions to become payment-service providers.	我是中文句子
The South African Reserve Bank has created a special platform within its national payment system for micro-finance institutions and non-banks.	我是中文句子
Malawi’s national payments system is directly accessible to non-bank participants, including third-party service providers.	我是中文句子
It will also help facilitate access by the poorest to financial services, thus helping to reduce the high proportion of the un-banked population.	我是中文句子
All of this will invariably spur development and integration of national financial systems and intra-regional trade.	我是中文句子
This will be a welcome development, because a large proportion of intra-regional trade is carried out by informal operators and small and medium enterprises that do not have access to the banking system.	我是中文句子
Moreover, economic integration and increased intra-regional trade are the best entry point into global markets for all countries.	我是中文句子
When it comes to analyzing what ails Africa, it is customary to dwell at length on the continent’s traumatic past.	我是中文句子
Abraham Lincoln once said that a house divided cannot stand.	我是中文句子
There is an economic corollary to this: an economic house divided cannot prosper.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Hard Black Gold	我是中文句子
LAGOS - Few infrastructure services in the developed world may be as taken for granted as electric power.	我是中文句子
To consumers in industrialized countries, uninterrupted power supply is a given.	我是中文句子
Not so in much of Africa, which experiences some of the world’s greatest power deficits, and where only two in ten people have access to electricity.	我是中文句子
There is no shortage of hydropower plants for electricity generation in Africa.	我是中文句子
However, many of these plants are unable to keep up with rapid population growth and attendant increases in demand.	我是中文句子
Increasingly burgeoning populations in countries like Nigeria and Ghana imply a greater extraction of water resources for power generation.	我是中文句子
Rapid expansion of agricultural activity is requiring more and more water all across the continent.	我是中文句子
Other resources like fuel oil, diesel, light crude, solar, and gas are also available as means of electricity generation, but their costs are all quite prohibitive.	我是中文句子
These factors make a good argument for coal as a cheap alternative source of Africa's power.	我是中文句子
Coal has historically played a crucial role as a source of energy worldwide, and has several important advantages over other fossil fuels.  First is its relative abundance.	我是中文句子
The current level of proven coal reserves worldwide stands at roughly 850 billion tons.	我是中文句子
Africa has about 50 billion tons.	我是中文句子
Coal is also much more widely distributed geographically than any other fossil fuel.	我是中文句子
Coal is the world’s fastest growing fossil fuel, with annual production increasing by 6.4% since 2004.	我是中文句子
It is already the dominant source of power generation in some very important energy-consuming nations.	我是中文句子
Much of the future increases in coal-fired electricity generation will come from strategically important developing countries like China and India.	我是中文句子
Even in many developed countries, coal still accounts for a large share of power generation.	我是中文句子
Coal plants currently provide more than half of America’s electricity supply.	我是中文句子
Denmark, which houses some of the most efficient coal-fired power plants in the world, equally relies on coal for half of its electricity production.	我是中文句子
The same is true for Germany, which is home to some of the most efficient pulverized coal combustion units in Europe.	我是中文句子
Poland uses coal for 98% of its electricity production, and South Africa uses coal for about 50% of its electricity production.	我是中文句子
In contrast, coal prices are more stable, and may remain that way for a long time.	我是中文句子
Apart from electric-power generation, coal also has wide application in a number of industries.	我是中文句子
It is pivotal in both steel and cement production.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the use of wood by Africa’s growing population is causing increasingly rapid deforestation in many countries.	我是中文句子
There is significant potential domestic demand for coal briquettes to replace wood for cooking and domestic and industrial heating.	我是中文句子
The demand outlook thus appears favorable for the coal industry, creating significant investment opportunities.	我是中文句子
Clearly, there are environmental drawbacks from the use of coal as an energy resource, and these concerns are far too important to overlook.	我是中文句子
The massive reserves notwithstanding, coal is still a finite resource.	我是中文句子
It must be mined with greater efficiency and with a view to mitigating the environmental impact.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, much greater attention is paid today to mine safety and the management of the by-products of coal use.	我是中文句子
With acid rain and other public-health hazards linked to coal combustion, more technologies are emerging for reducing harmful emissions from power plants.	我是中文句子
Fueled by research, the past few years have witnessed the development of increasingly cleaner and more energy-efficient coal-fired generation plants and the retirement of older technologies, especially in the developed world.	我是中文句子
Africa's mineral-rich countries must exploit their abundant natural resources.	我是中文句子
They must use coal to advance their economic development.	我是中文句子
Failure to do so would be a missed opportunity at a time when African countries must avail themselves of all available resources for poverty reduction.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Immunity	我是中文句子
ACCRA – The United States suffers rising job losses.	我是中文句子
Britain nationalizes its banks.	我是中文句子
Once high-flying small economies like Ireland, Hungary, and Iceland break down.	我是中文句子
Even robust China and India are experiencing slower growth, curtailed ambitions, and broken dreams.	我是中文句子
Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few hints of the global financial crisis that is consuming the capitalist world.	我是中文句子
In fashionable African cities, residential home prices remain stratospheric.	我是中文句子
While home prices are crashing from Madrid to Dublin and Miami to Los Angeles, African prices remain near or at record-high levels.	我是中文句子
African banks, meanwhile, are rock-solid compared to their debt-heavy counterparts in the US and Europe.	我是中文句子
And yet there are good reasons to believe that it is just a matter of time before Africa and its peoples experience the ill effects of the global crisis.	我是中文句子
From Ghana to Kenya, governments are having increased difficulty in raising money for infrastructure projects and selling official debt.	我是中文句子
All of these factors suggest that an African financial bust is possible.	我是中文句子
Popular equity investments, such as shares in Safaricom, are already trading at unexpectedly low levels.	我是中文句子
Remittances are already believed to be falling, which makes sense: immigrants in rich countries are and will be disproportionately hurt by slowing economic activity.	我是中文句子
Immigration itself may even slow dramatically, depending on the length and depth of the economic slowdown.	我是中文句子
Fewer Africans working in rich countries will automatically translate into less money circulating in African countries.	我是中文句子
The decline in remittances, however, cuts both ways.	我是中文句子
Remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of Africa.	我是中文句子
A Ugandan doctor working in Norway, for instance, cares little about the cost of a beer in Kampala.	我是中文句子
He is also willing – and able – to pay more than a local doctor for services and, of course, a home in Uganda.	我是中文句子
Fewer remittances flowing into Uganda could mean less economic activity – or simply lower prices.	我是中文句子
If his administration succeeds, the chances that Africa will remain relatively unscathed will grow.	我是中文句子
Even if Obama fails, however, Africans should escape the worst of the global crisis, for both good reasons and bad.	我是中文句子
Another factor working in Africa’s favor is its private companies’ and consumers’ low dependence on borrowed money.	我是中文句子
People tend to pay cash for goods and services, however costly.	我是中文句子
In the US, loans for cars and homes – loans that now aren’t being paid back – are the major factor behind the financial crisis.	我是中文句子
In Africa, very few people borrow money for such purchases.	我是中文句子
Africa’s cash-based economy has in the past constrained development.	我是中文句子
After all, by allowing people to spend more than they have, borrowed money can fuel growth.	我是中文句子
But today, Africa’s pay-as-you-go practices are a powerful defense against financial contagion.	我是中文句子
Ensuring Africa’s Continued Rise	我是中文句子
LAGOS – Africa’s rise is in danger of faltering.	我是中文句子
Ensuring the wealth and wellbeing of the continent’s residents will not be easy; but there is much that policymakers can do to put Africa back on an upward trajectory.	我是中文句子
First and foremost, policymakers must secure the financing needed to pursue sustainable development in an uncertain global environment.	我是中文句子
The World Bank estimates that Africa will require at least $93 billion a year to fund its infrastructure needs alone.	我是中文句子
Climate-friendly, sustainable infrastructure will cost even more.	我是中文句子
And yet, as long as global growth remains weak, Africans cannot count on developed countries to fully honor their commitments to help attain the Sustainable Development Goals.	我是中文句子
Africa must rapidly develop its own resources, beginning by nearly doubling tax revenues.	我是中文句子
Across Sub-Saharan Africa, tax revenues account for less than one-fifth of GDP, compared to more than one-third in OECD countries.	我是中文句子
This means there is plenty of room for improvement.	我是中文句子
Admittedly, such progress is difficult; in Nigeria, we saw an opportunity in raising non-oil tax revenues, but struggled to seize it.	我是中文句子
Another source of domestic resources is the roughly $380 billion in pension assets held by just ten African countries.	我是中文句子
Policymakers should be leveraging these considerable sums.	我是中文句子
At the same time, African countries will have to find a way to diversify their economies.	我是中文句子
Diversification requires investment in the future, in the form of education and well-developed infrastructure, including telecommunications, power, roads, rail, and water.	我是中文句子
Dubai, for example, set out more than three decades ago to prepare for a future without oil.	我是中文句子
South Korea and Singapore, which had few natural resources on which to rely, are no less inspiring.	我是中文句子
As the necessary measures for diversification are implemented, policymakers must ensure that the economic growth they are pursuing creates jobs.	我是中文句子
Sadly, this has not always been the case.	我是中文句子
Much of the recent growth has benefited only a few, leaving many behind – most notably young people and women.	我是中文句子
These were challenges that we were starting to address in Nigeria when I was finance minister.	我是中文句子
We knew that we needed not just to secure growth, but also to improve the quality of that growth.	我是中文句子
To that end, policymakers must ensure that growth is channeled into sectors that create jobs, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services.	我是中文句子
They may also have to redistribute income and strengthen social safety nets to protect better those at the bottom of the ladder.	我是中文句子
Matching skills to job opportunities will be crucial.	我是中文句子
Some 70% of Africa’s population is under 30, and the continent is home to half the world’s primary-school-age children who have been deprived of the opportunity to study.	我是中文句子
Offering Africa’s children basic reading, writing, and technology skills, as well as vocational, technical, and entrepreneurial training, must be a top priority.	我是中文句子
The stakes are high.	我是中文句子
The World Bank estimates the Ebola outbreak shrank the economies of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia by 16%.	我是中文句子
As the world economy sputters, African countries will have to develop trade with one another.	我是中文句子
In 2013, African goods and services accounted for just 16% of trade within the continent, and just over 3% of world trade.	我是中文句子
One problem is that most African countries produce the same type of commodities and trade them with very little value-added.	我是中文句子
Policymakers must encourage greater specialization; differentiated goods and services will add value and volume to trade.	我是中文句子
Logistics pose another obstacle to intra-African trade.	我是中文句子
Policymakers must make it easier to move goods across borders, by improving connectivity between countries and reducing bureaucratic hurdles and administrative costs.	我是中文句子
The Rift Valley Railway project, which will eventually link Mombasa on the Kenyan coast to Kampala in Uganda, is a good example of the benefits that investments in transportation could provide.	我是中文句子
The African Development Bank estimates that it will double the volume of trade between the two countries, while reducing marginal costs by 30%.	我是中文句子
Extending the continent’s rise will require strengthening the continent’s economic fundamentals.	我是中文句子
This means ensuring that prices in the economy are correct, starting with the exchange rate.	我是中文句子
Africa’s potential can hardly be overstated.	我是中文句子
The continent is well placed to build diversified economies based on low-carbon, sustainable infrastructure.	我是中文句子
But policymakers cannot simply assume that Africa’s rise will continue.	我是中文句子
They must take the right steps to ensure that it does.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Urban Farmers	我是中文句子
A nurse, Wangari counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land – for more farming.	我是中文句子
Even though Wangari lives in Kenya’s capital, she is able to reap hundreds of dollars a year in profit from cash crops grown with the help of relatives.	我是中文句子
Her initial stake – drawn from her nursing wages of about $350 a month – has long since been recovered.	我是中文句子
With prices for basic foodstuffs at their highest levels in decades, many urbanites feel well rewarded by farming.	我是中文句子
Moreover, absentee farmers face unexpected problems.	我是中文句子
Without her help, I might not have farmed at all.	我是中文句子
Even with mother’s help, I have worries.	我是中文句子
Although I grew up around wheat fields, my knowledge of farming is thin.	我是中文句子
Fertilizer and spraying were both more expensive than I thought.	我是中文句子
While my wheat stalks are sprouting on schedule, I now fear that at harvest time – in November – prices will fall and I won’t recoup my costs.	我是中文句子
One key tool is the mobile phone.	我是中文句子
My hopes for success are buoyed by my ability to call my mother inexpensively and discuss the farm.	我是中文句子
We even decided over the phone what kind of pesticide to use and which tractor company to hire.	我是中文句子
Because they know both the tastes of fellow city dwellers and rural conditions, many urban farmers are succeeding.	我是中文句子
James Memusi, an accountant, grows mushrooms in a spare bedroom, selling them to nearby hotels and supermarkets.	我是中文句子
In a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer, the authorities declared, “The soil is a bank; invest in it.”	我是中文句子
In Liberia, the main push is to reduce imports of staples such as rice and tomatoes.	我是中文句子
In Zambia, for example, Sylva Banda ignited a craze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants.	我是中文句子
Similarly, in Nairobi, Miringo Kinyanjui, another woman entrepreneur, is supplying unrefined – and more nutritious – maize and wheat flour.	我是中文句子
The revival of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations.	我是中文句子
Building Africa’s Scientific Talent	我是中文句子
A decade later, it is worth considering whether the continent is any closer to finding the next global genius.	我是中文句子
Statistically, there is indeed a high probability that it will happen.	我是中文句子
By 2050, 40% of the world’s young people will be African.	我是中文句子
By virtue of demographics alone, it stands to reason that Africa is destined to generate prodigies in science or technology.	我是中文句子
Africans have led the world in science before.	我是中文句子
In fact, some of humanity’s greatest innovations – from vaccines to brain surgery – were pioneered by Africans.	我是中文句子
In other words, mathematics itself is an African invention.	我是中文句子
With these visionaries now gone, Africa needs a new brain trust to inspire future generations of ethical and public-spirited researchers.	我是中文句子
But how do we ensure Africa discovers, supports, and develops innovative, game-changing scientists?	我是中文句子
At the moment, however, too many of Africa’s young researchers see no option but to go abroad for school and work.	我是中文句子
That can change, but only with concrete investments in homegrown talent.	我是中文句子
This means rethinking the entire education system in Africa.	我是中文句子
Three priorities stand out.	我是中文句子
First, African countries need to fix the knowledge pipeline.	我是中文句子
Second, Africa needs indigenous knowledge creation.	我是中文句子
This requires facilitating both fundamental and applied research and creating the necessary infrastructure for the dissemination of research outcomes.	我是中文句子
This could include making more funding available to researchers and research institutions, as well as promoting open sources for knowledge sharing.	我是中文句子
The third priority is putting knowledge into practice.	我是中文句子
A good example is Zipline, which deploys drone technology to deliver blood transfusions to remote areas of Rwanda.	我是中文句子
After successfully deploying the technology in Rwanda, it is currently being rolled out in Ghana.	我是中文句子
Zipline has saved hundreds of lives and demonstrated the potential of technology transfer with large-scale impact.	我是中文句子
The NEF focuses on convening Africa’s innovators to highlight breakthrough discoveries and catalyze scientific collaboration for human development.	我是中文句子
With so many complex issues vying for attention today, Africa will need innovative education and research models.	我是中文句子
Improving African Women’s Health Through Financial Inclusion	我是中文句子
ACCRA – In late October, the World Health Organization’s Regional Office for Africa signed an agreement with the United Nations International Telecommunication Union (ITU).	我是中文句子
The aim of the unlikely partnership is to encourage the use of digital services “to save lives and improve people’s health.”	我是中文句子
But perhaps the pact’s most innovative feature is the vow to merge financial inclusion strategies with modern health-care delivery.	我是中文句子
Financial inclusion is a proven pathway to improving people’s health, especially the health of women in developing countries.	我是中文句子
Women who can easily access bank accounts or cash payment options tend to invest more in their businesses and families.	我是中文句子
In turn, they live healthier, more satisfying lives.	我是中文句子
The cost of this choice is disproportionately high for Africa’s women.	我是中文句子
In Nigeria, for example, 400,000 women live with obstetric fistula, a disabling condition often caused by complications in childbirth.	我是中文句子
In Tanzania, some 8,000 women die annually during pregnancy or delivery; most of these deaths could be prevented.	我是中文句子
And, across the continent, women’s life expectancy at birth is just 58 years, compared to more than 80 years in developed countries.	我是中文句子
Progress is being made to connect women’s health solutions and financial inclusion.	我是中文句子
Through programs like these, development experts can advocate for digital solutions as a means of social and financial empowerment.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, cooperation like the pact signed in October is the exception, rather than the norm.	我是中文句子
Banks, regulators, finance ministries, and telecommunications companies all frequently gather to consider financial inclusion without the local and global health community.	我是中文句子
This must change if we are to build more inclusive platforms for African patients and clients.	我是中文句子
The first step is to identify missed opportunities.	我是中文句子
A big one stems from the disparate approaches to bringing financial services and digitized health care to rural parts of Africa.	我是中文句子
At the moment, banks and mobile network operators are working to expand their digital banking services to unbanked and under-banked clients.	我是中文句子
At the same time, community health workers (CHWs) are operating in these regions to prevent, treat, and refer patients to clinics.	我是中文句子
Combining these efforts makes sense, because both initiatives rely heavily on trust.	我是中文句子
Through pre-established networks, CHWs could augment their e-health offerings with financial products, like mobile cash payment systems.	我是中文句子
Broadening digital disease management and access to health information to include financial wellbeing would create natural synergies.	我是中文句子
While there are some concerns that adding responsibilities to CHWs could undermine health-care quality, a fragmented approach to prosperity is even more damaging.	我是中文句子
Once opportunities for expansion are identified, other issues will need to be addressed before women’s health and financial inclusion programs can be widened.	我是中文句子
For starters, a lack of sex-disaggregated data makes it difficult to draft policies based on health quality and financial need.	我是中文句子
Although some countries, such as Burundi and Senegal, are working to improve their gender-specific data collection, a broader, more coordinated push is needed.	我是中文句子
Raising the region’s financial literacy will be another challenge.	我是中文句子
The ability to understand and execute matters of personal finance is the weakest link in transforming women’s opportunities through financial inclusion.	我是中文句子
Moreover, financial literacy is a pre-requisite for the rollout of financing initiatives, such as programs that support women-led small and micro-enterprises.	我是中文句子
Progress has been made in leveling the playing field, but these gains must be sustained.	我是中文句子
The agreement between the WHO and the ITU will help promote wealth creation in parts of Africa where access to health care and financial services is lacking.	我是中文句子
To maintain this momentum, deeper commitments are needed, especially from the global health community.	我是中文句子
But, however African governments proceed in digitizing their health and financial services offerings, women’s needs must remain at the center of any solution.	我是中文句子
Closing the Youth Apathy Gap	我是中文句子
That commitment will be virtually impossible to fulfill, unless political participation by young people increases considerably.	我是中文句子
Young people are critical to progress.	我是中文句子
And youth now comprise a large share of those people – 18% of the world’s population, to be precise.	我是中文句子
The share is even larger in much of the developing world.	我是中文句子
The median age of Africa’s population is just 19.5 years.	我是中文句子
But that requires them to be engaged and active.	我是中文句子
In the United Kingdom, most young people wish to remain in the European Union.	我是中文句子
Presumably having learned their lesson from the Brexit referendum, young Britons contributed to an unexpected victory for Labour in June’s snap general election.	我是中文句子
In Kenya’s presidential election, held last month, 51% of registered voters were below the age of 35 years.	我是中文句子
Although the Supreme Court annulled the results and ordered a fresh vote, owing to electoral irregularities and illegalities, large numbers of young people are likely to turn out again.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, Kenya is the exception that proves the rule.	我是中文句子
Political apathy among young people, like that seen in the Brexit referendum, remains pervasive worldwide.	我是中文句子
To avoid such outcomes, young people need to be part of their countries’ political life, able to advance their own vision of the future.	我是中文句子
As young Kenyans repeated during the recent election campaign, “If you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”	我是中文句子
So what can be done to increase political awareness and participation among young people?	我是中文句子
Though somewhat dysfunctional, these institutions have helped to empower Kenyan youth, driving the high election turnout last month.	我是中文句子
But perhaps the most effective approach to closing the apathy gap focuses on initiatives led by young people themselves.	我是中文句子
Their success inspired a global campaign to support young people’s right to run for office.	我是中文句子
That survey showed that, while 27% of respondents had never engaged politically, 26% had attended an event and 34% had posted on social media.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, many Kenyans who were popular on social media did not make much of an impact on the election’s outcome.	我是中文句子
Translating social media energy into effective action in the real world remains a daunting challenge.	我是中文句子
Increasing youth involvement in politics will require sustained commitment and hard work.	我是中文句子
But, far from a deterrent, this should serve as a powerful incentive to get started.	我是中文句子
No one is more affected by past, present, and future policies than young people.	我是中文句子
They must take their seat at the table, not wait until one is offered.	我是中文句子
The Transformative Power of Africa’s Youth	我是中文句子
After they finished sharing their plans, I congratulated them, and said that their parents must be very proud.	我是中文句子
But instead of accepting the compliment, they demurred.	我是中文句子
For ambitious young Africans, there are many obstacles to success.	我是中文句子
The journey to a job – whether formal or informal, entrepreneurial or traditional – is often a solitary one.	我是中文句子
Many young people lack access to skills training or even a favorable social environment to try something new.	我是中文句子
As I was reminded that day in Senegal, helping young people find gainful employment is the most important thing that the international community can do to help Africa develop.	我是中文句子
Africa is home to the world’s largest population of young people.	我是中文句子
In about 25 years, those young people will be part of the biggest workforce in the world, with more than 1.1 billion people of working age.	我是中文句子
By some forecasts, 11 million people will enter Africa’s labor market each year for the next decade, most of whom will be first-time job seekers.	我是中文句子
In turn, millions would have the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty.	我是中文句子
But Africa cannot achieve this future alone.	我是中文句子
At the Mastercard Foundation, we believe that, if Africa is to reach its potential, gaps in two keys areas must be closed.	我是中文句子
The first area is access to financial products and services.	我是中文句子
According to the World Bank, some two billion people around the world currently lack such access.	我是中文句子
This must change, with Africans gaining not only better access to banking systems, but also improved financial literacy.	我是中文句子
The second key challenge that must be addressed is exclusion from secondary and higher education.	我是中文句子
While progress has been made in some regions, only about one-third of Africa’s young people graduate from high school.	我是中文句子
If we succeed, Africa’s dreamers of today will be the catalysts of positive change tomorrow.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Defining Challenge	我是中文句子
ADDIS ABABA – Africa has the youngest population in the world, and it’s growing fast.	我是中文句子
By 2055, the continent’s youth population (aged 15-24), is expected to be more than double the 2015 total of 226 million.	我是中文句子
Yet the continent remains stubbornly inhospitable – politically, economically, and socially – to young people.	我是中文句子
The success of African governments’ efforts to address this will be the single most important factor determining whether the continent prospers or suffers in the coming decades.	我是中文句子
But Africa can thrive if its governments act now to tap the energy and dynamism of the burgeoning youth population.	我是中文句子
It does not help that a tradition of gerontocracy prevails in many countries, meaning that young people’s political participation and influence is restricted on cultural grounds.	我是中文句子
Much work also remains to be done on the economic front.	我是中文句子
That means that millions of young people were left without a stake in the economy.	我是中文句子
In the short and medium term, it will be virtually impossible to create enough jobs to meet the needs of the unemployed and vulnerably employed.	我是中文句子
Africa does not have a large labor-intensive manufacturing sector to absorb its mushrooming young population.	我是中文句子
But there are programs that can help.	我是中文句子
Still, given the dearth of opportunities at home, many young Africans view migration as a chance for social mobility.	我是中文句子
Yet, as the CEO of a major company based in Sub-Saharan Africa recently lamented to me, acquiring work visas for Africans is extremely difficult.	我是中文句子
In fact, it can be easier to get a work visa for a British citizen than for, say, a Ghanaian with the same skills.	我是中文句子
Yet, contrary to popular belief, young people are not migrating from Africa exclusively for economic reasons.	我是中文句子
Rather, they are motivated by the promise of opportunities for genuine self-improvement and the freedom to decide who to be and how to live.	我是中文句子
That is certainly what led me to leave Africa and head to Europe at a young age.	我是中文句子
Political and cultural exclusion intensifies it.	我是中文句子
Given this, any strategy that does not address the broader environment of marginalization is a bridge to nowhere.	我是中文句子
So far, Africa seems to be sleepwalking into a future of lost opportunity and, potentially, serious instability.	我是中文句子
And Africa’s international partners have remained preoccupied with containing migration from the continent, rather than addressing its underlying causes.	我是中文句子
But there may be reason for hope.	我是中文句子
The fifth European Union-Africa Summit, to be held later this year, will focus squarely on the continent’s young people.	我是中文句子
Likewise, the African Union’s theme for 2017 is “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend Through Investments in Youth.”	我是中文句子
To paraphrase Martin Luther King, Africa confronts the fierce urgency of now.	我是中文句子
There is such a thing as being too late.	我是中文句子
Listening to Africa’s Future Farmers	我是中文句子
NAIROBI – Africa is in the midst of a youth employment crisis.	我是中文句子
By 2035, some 350 million new jobs will be needed, and agriculture, the continent’s biggest industry, could provide the bulk of them.	我是中文句子
But at the moment, young Africans are shunning life on the farm for work in the city.	我是中文句子
If Africa’s employment gap is to be closed, agribusinesses must find ways to recruit younger hands.	我是中文句子
In a recent report, we examined the experiences of young African agriculturalists in seven countries.	我是中文句子
And what we discovered is that the best way to entice young people back to the farm is by improving access to and engagement with emerging technologies.	我是中文句子
Many of the young people with whom we spoke said that their biggest obstacle to a career in farming is learning the digital and technical skills necessary to succeed in today’s agricultural market.	我是中文句子
It stands to reason, then, that if more young people could master digital skills, more would find work in the field.	我是中文句子
To understand how important technology is to the young African farmer, consider competition for land.	我是中文句子
Most farmland is acquired through hereditary or communal distribution systems, and when new plots are allocated, they are typically smaller than those provided to previous generations.	我是中文句子
To remain profitable, younger growers must produce larger crops from smaller spaces, which requires innovation.	我是中文句子
Our study found that in many cases, the best solutions for young farmers are already being designed by young people.	我是中文句子
For example, in Kenya, one vegetable grower turned her kitchen garden into a vertical farm to increase its output.	我是中文句子
Today, she runs her own business designing, fabricating, and installing similar structures for a variety of customers.	我是中文句子
Another interviewee created a mobile app to help farmers connect with local seed and fertilizer suppliers.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, these types of youth-driven innovations rarely receive the necessary political or financial backing to make them viable and scalable.	我是中文句子
Despite having great ideas, most young agricultural innovators do not feel supported in their efforts.	我是中文句子
Young people can help solve Africa’s unemployment challenges, but those closest to the problem have yet to be made part of the solution.	我是中文句子
Our research suggests several strategies to achieve this outcome.	我是中文句子
For starters, young people need places to engage with like-minded innovators.	我是中文句子
Moreover, those who promote new farm technologies should travel to the places where young people gather, to provide hands-on, audience-specific training.	我是中文句子
Next, young people need access to financial products and services to help them turn their ideas into marketable businesses.	我是中文句子
And, finally, countries must find ways to involve their youth in early stages of the technology-development pipeline.	我是中文句子
As the experience of the Kenyan gardener illustrates, young people are often the best judges of what will deliver long-term, practical results.	我是中文句子
I spoke about the role young people play in Africa’s economy, and the importance of soliciting their views on the future of African agriculture.	我是中文句子
It was an important first step in bringing young peoples’ ideas to the table.	我是中文句子
But much work remains to be done.	我是中文句子
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the average age of an African farmer today is about 60, while 60% of the population is under the age of 24.	我是中文句子
To breathe new life into Africa’s farms, the entire industry must innovate.	我是中文句子
And, as our research shows, the best way to do that is by working much more closely with those who have the most to gain from progress.	我是中文句子
After Assimilation	我是中文句子
Human migration is as old as history. Even migration to distant places and remote cultures is nothing new.	我是中文句子
In the nineteenth century, millions of Europeans sought liberty and prosperity in the Americas, notably in the United States.	我是中文句子
What is new today is the scale of migration, often across huge cultural divides - and often without a definite aim.	我是中文句子
The African boat people in the Mediterranean are often not even sure whether they want to be in Italy, Germany, or Britain.	我是中文句子
Once upon a time, North America, notably the US, seemed to provide the answer.	我是中文句子
The ingredients of the melting pot are separating.	我是中文句子
Even in Israel, the last true immigration country - at least for Jews - assimilation is no longer so easy.	我是中文句子
Recent newcomers from Russia have their own political party, and old Europeans have become a distinct minority.	我是中文句子
Israel and America continue to have mechanisms to integrate new migrants.	我是中文句子
Language is an important underlying factor, and in Israel, there is the army, while in America, the values embodied in the Constitution still represent a shared secular faith.	我是中文句子
But these mechanisms are weakening everywhere, and are virtually non-existent in European countries.	我是中文句子
Modern societies are characterized by acute problems of belonging.	我是中文句子
They don't offer the implicit, unconscious ties of community that citizens felt in the past. As a result, people have begun to cling to other, more primordial group identities.	我是中文句子
They resist assimilation, fearing that it will rob them of their identity without offering a new one.	我是中文句子
What then is the alternative to assimilation?	我是中文句子
The "salad bowl" of so-called multiculturalism is no real alternative, because it does not provide the necessary glue that binds communities together.	我是中文句子
All the ingredients remain separate from the outset.	我是中文句子
In theory, this is a distinctly second-best solution to the cultural consequences of migration; in practice it is the best answer we have.	我是中文句子
But it cannot be had for nothing.	我是中文句子
Even the necessary minimum of a common language requires a deliberate effort, to say nothing of certain rules of behavior.	我是中文句子
This is clearly easier in London and New York than it is in smaller towns or even in the capitals of countries where the world language of English is not spoken.	我是中文句子
Berlin's Turkish community and the North African communities around Paris seem increasingly separate, with their own public sphere and often language.	我是中文句子
If we are forced to abandon the hope of assimilation, our efforts should concentrate on creating a public space to which all contribute and that all enjoy.	我是中文句子
Ideally, this should be an expanding public space, for in the end, the element of unity in a modern society is the guarantee of its citizens' liberty.	我是中文句子
After Austerity	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – This year’s annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund made clear that Europe and the international community remain rudderless when it comes to economic policy.	我是中文句子
Confidence, it was repeatedly said, needs to be restored.	我是中文句子
Worse, seldom is it explained how to square the circle.	我是中文句子
How can confidence be restored as the crisis economies plunge into recession?	我是中文句子
How can growth be revived when austerity will almost surely mean a further decrease in aggregate demand, sending output and employment even lower?	我是中文句子
This we should know by now: markets on their own are not stable.	我是中文句子
Not only do they repeatedly generate destabilizing asset bubbles, but, when demand weakens, forces that exacerbate the downturn come into play.	我是中文句子
Unemployment, and fear that it will spread, drives down wages, incomes, and consumption – and thus total demand.	我是中文句子
There are alternative strategies.	我是中文句子
Some countries, like Germany, have room for fiscal maneuver. Using it for investment would enhance long-term growth, with positive spillovers to the rest of Europe.	我是中文句子
Europe as a whole is not in bad fiscal shape; its debt-to-GDP ratio compares favorably with that of the United States.	我是中文句子
If each US state were totally responsible for its own budget, including paying all unemployment benefits, America, too, would be in fiscal crisis.	我是中文句子
The lesson is obvious:  the whole is more than the sum of its parts.	我是中文句子
There are already institutions within Europe, such as the European Investment Bank, that could help finance needed investments in the cash-starved economies.	我是中文句子
The EIB should expand its lending.	我是中文句子
Europe’s single-minded focus on austerity is a result of a misdiagnosis of its problems.	我是中文句子
Greece overspent, but Spain and Ireland had fiscal surpluses and low debt-to-GDP ratios before the crisis.	我是中文句子
Giving lectures about fiscal prudence is beside the point.	我是中文句子
Taking the lectures seriously –  even adopting tight budget frameworks – can be counterproductive.	我是中文句子
The consequences of Europe’s rush to austerity will be long-lasting and possibly severe.	我是中文句子
If the euro survives, it will come at the price of high unemployment and enormous suffering, especially in the crisis countries.	我是中文句子
And the crisis itself almost surely will spread.	我是中文句子
As a result, society’s most valuable asset, its human capital, is being wasted and even destroyed.	我是中文句子
When they eventually find work, it will be at a much lower wage.	我是中文句子
Normally, youth is a time when skills get built up; now, it is a time when they atrophy.	我是中文句子
But that is what Europe is doing.	我是中文句子
Indeed, its leaders’ willful ignorance of the lessons of the past is criminal.	我是中文句子
The pain that Europe, especially its poor and young, is suffering is unnecessary.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, there is an alternative.	我是中文句子
But delay in grasping it will be very costly, and Europe is running out of time.	我是中文句子
Immunization Independence	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – The first years of this century have been heady ones for global health.	我是中文句子
But now some of the countries that have benefited from these programs face a new challenge: sustaining the gains they have made once external support is withdrawn.	我是中文句子
Ultimately, it is on the basis of this transition that donors’ initiatives – and the health aid enterprise as a whole – will be judged.	我是中文句子
Consider Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.	我是中文句子
When a country’s annual per capita income rises above a certain threshold – currently $1,580 – it becomes ineligible for Gavi support.	我是中文句子
Of course, Gavi doesn’t just cut off funding all at once.	我是中文句子
Support is phased out over a period of several years.	我是中文句子
During this transition period, countries rapidly increase their financial contribution to their immunization programs and prepare to assume full responsibility.	我是中文句子
This approach, which enables Gavi to concentrate its resources on countries with the greatest need, has been in place since 2010.	我是中文句子
The group includes countries as different from one another as Armenia, Bhutan, Honduras, and Vietnam, as well as India and Nigeria, which have the largest birth cohorts.	我是中文句子
The Gavi model is now under the microscope.	我是中文句子
Will countries be able to continue purchasing and delivering the vaccines that were introduced with Gavi support?	我是中文句子
Equally important, will that commitment hold up over time?	我是中文句子
If government budgets are cut, will immunization be protected, along with other essential health services?	我是中文句子
Will countries be able to introduce new lifesaving vaccines as they become available?	我是中文句子
Will they sustain and strengthen disease surveillance, so that outbreaks are detected and addressed quickly?	我是中文句子
After all, infectious diseases do not respect national boundaries.	我是中文句子
The recent yellow fever epidemic in Angola, for example, spread to its much poorer neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Congo.	我是中文句子
The experiences of countries that have “graduated” from Gavi assistance will also hold important lessons for other international health programs and their beneficiaries.	我是中文句子
With so much at stake, international agencies must do whatever they can to prepare countries for “life after Gavi.”	我是中文句子
For some of these countries, especially those that have adopted many new vaccines, obtaining adequate and sustainable financing is one of the most daunting challenges posed by the transition.	我是中文句子
A new resource can help countries as they wrestle with this challenge.	我是中文句子
It does not prescribe one way forward, but rather provides relevant information and expert analysis.	我是中文句子
Countries can then evaluate options in light of their own circumstances, and advocates can ask the right questions.	我是中文句子
With Gavi support, close to 580 million children have been immunized since 2000, and more than eight million future deaths have been averted.	我是中文句子
These are impressive gains that are worth celebrating.	我是中文句子
But only if countries successfully negotiate the transition from Gavi support can they be confident that future generations will enjoy the same health protections.	我是中文句子
After Kyoto	我是中文句子
The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far.	我是中文句子
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be discussed by the European Council next March.	我是中文句子
At the end of the day, the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system, an incentives system, and investments in technology change.	我是中文句子
Increasingly, adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding.	我是中文句子
Dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive, but complementary.	我是中文句子
Looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change.	我是中文句子
However, it is the developing countries – and thus the world’s poor – who are most vulnerable.	我是中文句子
Working with partners, the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change.	我是中文句子
Therefore, projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007.	我是中文句子
The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool, and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market.	我是中文句子
The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities.	我是中文句子
After Paris	我是中文句子
But whatever the rationale, what is certain is that a clear response is warranted.	我是中文句子
Actually, the challenge posed by the Islamic State calls for several responses, as there is no single policy that promises to be sufficient.	我是中文句子
Multiple efforts are needed in multiple domains.	我是中文句子
One is military.	我是中文句子
More intense attacks from the air against Islamic State military assets, oil and gas facilities, and leaders are critical.	我是中文句子
But no amount of air power on its own will ever get the job done.	我是中文句子
A substantial ground component is needed if territory is to be taken and held.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, there is no time to build a partner force on the ground from scratch.	我是中文句子
This has been tried and failed, and Arab states are unable or unwilling to constitute one.	我是中文句子
The Iraqi army has also come up short.	我是中文句子
Iran-backed militias only make matters worse.	我是中文句子
The best option is to work more closely with Kurdish troops and select Sunni tribes in both Iraq and Syria.	我是中文句子
Such an effort must be collective.	我是中文句子
The packaging matters less than the results.	我是中文句子
Symbolic declarations of war, though, ought to be considered with caution, lest the Islamic State appear to be winning every day it does not lose.	我是中文句子
A diplomatic component is no less essential to any response.	我是中文句子
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is a recruiting tool for the Islamic State and must go.	我是中文句子
But any successor government must be able to maintain order and not permit the Islamic State to exploit a power vacuum, as it has done in Libya.	我是中文句子
Moreover, orderly political change can be brought about only with Russian and Iranian support.	我是中文句子
But reaching a compromise along these lines could well be impossible.	我是中文句子
This is why increased military effort is needed to bring about larger and more secure enclaves that could better protect civilians and take the fight to the Islamic State.	我是中文句子
A Syria of enclaves or cantons is a more realistic model for the foreseeable future.	我是中文句子
Other indispensable elements of any effective strategy include expanded help for or pressure on Turkey to do much more to stem the flow of recruits to the Islamic State.	我是中文句子
And Turkey, along with Jordan and Lebanon, need more financial assistance as they shoulder the bulk of the refugee burden.	我是中文句子
Arab and Muslim leaders can do their part by speaking out to challenge the Islamic State’s vision and delegitimize its behavior.	我是中文句子
There is also a domestic dimension to policy.	我是中文句子
Homeland security and law enforcement – increasing protection both at borders and within them – will have to adjust to the increased threat.	我是中文句子
Retail terrorists – individuals or small groups carrying out armed attacks against soft targets in open societies – are extremely difficult to deal with.	我是中文句子
The threat and the reality of attacks will require greater social resilience and quite possibly a rebalancing of individual privacy and collective security.	我是中文句子
What is also required is a dose of realism.	我是中文句子
The struggle against the Islamic State is not a conventional war.	我是中文句子
Indeed, terrorism is and will continue to be one of the scourges of this era.	我是中文句子
The good news, though, is that the threat posed by the Islamic State to the Middle East and the rest of the world can be dramatically reduced through sustained, concerted action.	我是中文句子
The main lesson of the attack on Paris is that we must be prepared to act over time and place alike.	我是中文句子
After Pax Americana?	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – It has become popular to suggest that when the dust settles from the global financial crisis, it may become clear that the United States-led post-war world has come to an end.	我是中文句子
If so, the global system that has secured peace, security, openness, and economic growth over the past six decades could be in grave danger.	我是中文句子
Despite talk about American decline, the world is not prepared for a post-American era.	我是中文句子
Do countries around the world believe that they will be better off if the global trade system breaks down or international shipping lanes become less secure?	我是中文句子
Unless other countries become more willing to step forward for the common good, a post-American world could quickly become a far more frightening environment than what it would replace.	我是中文句子
Even at the apex of American power, America’s greatness was always based on inspiring others, and the opportunities for building market share in that particular category remain unlimited.	我是中文句子
Closing the prison at Guantánamo and reaffirming America’s commitment to international law and human rights will also be an important step in this direction.	我是中文句子
The world wants to believe in an America that lives up to its own best values.	我是中文句子
The prospect of a truly global community of nations working together to achieve the greater good for all is indeed exciting.	我是中文句子
But, although America has been far from perfect over the last six decades, the end of the pax Americana has the potential to create a dangerous void in international affairs.	我是中文句子
If the world is going to shift in the direction of a new and more globally democratic system, other nations will need to meaningfully step forward to assume new responsibilities.	我是中文句子
After the Guns of August	我是中文句子
The Middle East is a place where the dust hardly ever settles.	我是中文句子
Let’s start with the United States.	我是中文句子
President George W. Bush has been short on neither initiatives nor catchy slogans and acronyms.	我是中文句子
But like all his previous initiatives since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington almost five years ago now, the NME ran into trouble from the outset.	我是中文句子
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced its birth while rejecting an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon.	我是中文句子
This so embarrassed the three Arab NME partners that each raced to distance itself from the US-sponsored initiative.	我是中文句子
As for America, anything it touches in the Middle East has become radioactive, even for longstanding clients and friends.	我是中文句子
This and numerous other resolutions seeking redress for injustices toward Palestinians have been ignored by the US.	我是中文句子
Thus, for 300 million Arabs and more than one billion Muslims the “root cause” of the Middle East conflict is not Hezbollah.	我是中文句子
It may well be that there is more than one root cause – every party to the conflict has a favorite one.	我是中文句子
There is no point in belaboring whose pain is greater or whose root cause is deeper.	我是中文句子
In fact, arguing over grievances merely drives the sides further apart.	我是中文句子
The long overdue UN Resolution 1701 may, with its adoption, indicate that all parties are fatigued, or could no longer withstand international pressure.	我是中文句子
This is good news for all concerned and provides an opportunity to tackle each party’s “root cause.”	我是中文句子
Seizing the opportunity requires that humility rather than moral supremacy prevails.	我是中文句子
Empathy, not ethnocentrism, should be the order of the day now that the guns are falling silent and we have rediscovered the limits of military force.	我是中文句子
After the Millennium Development Goals	我是中文句子
As the deadline approaches, development experts are debating a new question: What comes next?	我是中文句子
It is virtually certain that many of the MDGs will not have been met by the end of 2015, but there have been striking successes in some areas.	我是中文句子
At the same time, there is little evidence to suggest that those successes were the result of the MDGs themselves.	我是中文句子
China implemented the policies that engineered history’s greatest poverty eradication program prior to, and independently from, the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs.	我是中文句子
Clearly, however, the MDGs were a public-relations triumph, which is not to belittle their contribution.	我是中文句子
Like all worthwhile PR efforts, the MDGs served to raise awareness, galvanize attention, and mobilize action – all for a good cause.	我是中文句子
They amplified the global conversation about development and defined its terms.	我是中文句子
And there is evidence that they got advanced countries to pay more attention to poor nations.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the MDGs possibly had their clearest impact on aid flows from rich to poor countries.	我是中文句子
However, aid was not directly linked to performance and results, and it is much more difficult to know whether it had the desired impact overall.	我是中文句子
The MDGs encompass eight goals, 21 targets, and 60 indicators.	我是中文句子
But these complaints miss the point.	我是中文句子
Any effort that is concrete and implementable needs to monitor the results, and setting clear numerical targets is the best way to do so.	我是中文句子
Still, a central paradox plagues the MDGs.	我是中文句子
The Millennium Declaration was meant to be a compact between the world’s rich and poor countries.	我是中文句子
Poor countries promised to refocus their development efforts while rich countries pledged to support them with finance, technology, and access to their markets.	我是中文句子
Why we need a global effort to convince developing countries to do what is good for them is not clear.	我是中文句子
Poverty reduction and human development should be the first order of business for governments in these countries, with or without the MDGs.	我是中文句子
It is true, of course, that these governments often pursue different goals, for political, military, and other reasons.	我是中文句子
But it is wishful thinking to believe that they can be persuaded to act otherwise by international declarations that lack enforcement mechanisms.	我是中文句子
Equally problematic, the MDGs implicitly assume that we know how to achieve development targets, and that only resources and political will are missing.	我是中文句子
But it is doubtful that even well-intentioned policymakers have a good handle on, say, how to raise secondary-school completion rates sustainably or reduce maternal mortality.	我是中文句子
Many development economists would argue that significant improvements in governance and political institutions are required before such goals can be achieved.	我是中文句子
The most that rich countries can do is to provide an enabling environment for the benefit of developing countries that are willing and able to take advantage of it.	我是中文句子
These considerations suggest an obvious direction for the next iteration of the MDGs.	我是中文句子
First, a new global compact should focus more directly on rich countries’ responsibilities.	我是中文句子
Second, it should emphasize policies beyond aid and trade that have an equal, if not greater, impact on poor countries’ development prospects.	我是中文句子
“Do no harm” is as good a principle here as it is in medicine.	我是中文句子
This kind of reorientation will not be easy.	我是中文句子
Advanced countries are certain to resist any new commitments.	我是中文句子
But most of these measures do not cost money, and, as the MDGs have shown, setting targets can be used to mobilize action from rich-country governments.	我是中文句子
If the international community is going to invest in a bold new public-relations initiative, it might as well focus on areas where the potential payoffs are the greatest.	我是中文句子
After the Promised Land	我是中文句子
LONDON – At the height of the Arab uprisings last spring, many Europeans were gripped by nightmare visions of a tsunami of migrants crashing against the continent’s shores.	我是中文句子
In many countries, more immigrants are leaving than are arriving, owing mainly to the economic crisis that has drained jobs in the West.	我是中文句子
That reversal is one of the great under-reported stories of 2011 (and of the preceding two years), and the numbers are startling.	我是中文句子
Consider Spain, which is on track to lose more than a half-million residents by 2020.	我是中文句子
By contrast, between 2002 and 2008, Spain’s population grew by 700,000 a year, driven largely by immigration.	我是中文句子
The trends are similar elsewhere in Europe.	我是中文句子
Although rapidly aging Western countries are unable to attract the immigrants they need, they allow millions who are already there to suffer discrimination and abuse.	我是中文句子
Detentions and deportations take place under sometimes terrible conditions.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, the international community collectively fails to protect vast populations of vulnerable migrants, such as the millions stranded by the recent conflicts in North Africa.	我是中文句子
Undoubtedly, rising anti-immigrant populism must be confronted.	我是中文句子
While polling suggests that attitudes are influenced more by ethnicity than religion, both help to define identities and mindsets.	我是中文句子
Political parties in France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands (to name a few) have run successful campaigns that scapegoat immigrants.	我是中文句子
Moreover, governments from Alabama to Hungary are passing laws that undermine what should be migrants’ rights.	我是中文句子
Italy recently adopted harsh “emergency” decrees that target migrants by making undocumented entry and residence a criminal offense.	我是中文句子
Anti-immigrant rhetoric from the political extremes has fed into mainstream political discourse.	我是中文句子
European leaders trip over themselves to declare, one more forcefully than the next, that multiculturalism is dead.	我是中文句子
In the US, alligator-filled moats and electrified border fences have featured in the current presidential campaign.	我是中文句子
Growing discrimination in employment, housing, and education affects not just immigrants and their children; it harms our societies as a whole.	我是中文句子
With the lull in net immigration, we now have a window of opportunity to address these shortcomings.	我是中文句子
It would also be useful to explain that immigration is necessary for prosperity and growth in almost all OECD countries.	我是中文句子
The gaps in these countries’ labor markets – from software specialists to physicians to home health aides – will be immense.	我是中文句子
The priorities are clear.	我是中文句子
And, where it is clear that immigrants will be needed, we must be able to identify, welcome, integrate, and protect them.	我是中文句子
Countries must learn to work together to achieve these goals, few of which can be reached by going it alone.	我是中文句子
If our toolbox were empty, our inaction might be understandable.	我是中文句子
But examples of smart migration practices abound.	我是中文句子
Canada and the Philippines, for instance, have a well-functioning accord that protects the rights of temporary workers.	我是中文句子
Sweden has developed legislation that minimizes bureaucracy for companies that need foreign workers.	我是中文句子
And important advances have been made in ensuring that immigrant children receive the education that they need to become full members of society.	我是中文句子
Progress is being made on the global level as well, despite the economic crisis and populist headwinds.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, the Global Forum on Migration and Development, established in 2007, has quickly become an important means of fostering knowledge and partnerships.	我是中文句子
The reason for growing international cooperation is simple: countries everywhere are affected by migration, and, increasingly, they are experiencing immigration and emigration simultaneously.	我是中文句子
Highly skilled workers, such as bankers and engineers, are flocking to China.	我是中文句子
Mexico, known primarily as a country of emigration, is home to millions of migrants from Central America.	我是中文句子
Millions of people in Southeast Asia venture to the Middle East to work, but millions more cross borders within the region.	我是中文句子
The list goes on.	我是中文句子
When it comes to migration, we are all in the same boat – and that boat is leaking.	我是中文句子
Starting in 2012, countries should redouble their efforts to fix it.	我是中文句子
A Future without Precedent	我是中文句子
JERUSALEM – In my nearly nine decades of life, I cannot recall a time in which the past was so irrelevant to policymaking.	我是中文句子
All of today’s significant developments went unpredicted by anyone.	我是中文句子
Experts studied the past, but, constrained by old paradigms, they could not discern the future.	我是中文句子
The only certainty is that the future will be defined by scientific progress and innovation, which cannot be known ahead of time.	我是中文句子
As a result, the traditional power of states and leaders is declining; in today’s global economy, innovators, not politicians, wield the most influence.	我是中文句子
The globalized economy affects every state, yet no single state can determine the outcomes, because science and technology are borderless.	我是中文句子
The young leaders who created Facebook and Google have had a greater global impact than many statesmen and generals.	我是中文句子
These young people are also the leaders of erupting political protest movements.	我是中文句子
The young generation understands that the way states and economies are currently run is unfit for the new era.	我是中文句子
Yet there are political “hitchhikers” who want to exploit the recent awakening, not by promoting an agenda of freedom, but by imposing a different type of coercion.	我是中文句子
In the Arab world, it is mainly extreme Islamists who are hijacking the young generation’s wave, stealing their revolution.	我是中文句子
Israel has reacted positively to the will of the young generation, but it cannot and should not intervene in events in the Arab world.	我是中文句子
Fundamentalist radicals cannot provide real solutions to the region’s basic problems.	我是中文句子
The social changes now underway threaten their way of life, which includes discrimination against women and a ban on modern education.	我是中文句子
But only profound reforms of traditional authority can pave the way towards freedom and growth.	我是中文句子
We returned to our homeland, rich with history, but devoid of natural resources.	我是中文句子
Israel was left with only one resource: its human capital.	我是中文句子
So we invested in education and science, and today we have the world’s highest percentage of scientists and patents per capita.	我是中文句子
Roughly 95% of our agriculture is hi-tech.	我是中文句子
We use less water and yield more crops per acre than any other country in the world.	我是中文句子
What Israel can do, others can do as well.	我是中文句子
We will gladly offer a helping hand to whoever is willing to reach for it.	我是中文句子
Together, in peace with our neighbors, we can create a region of hope, development, and success.	我是中文句子
In particular, we must do everything in our power to end the conflict with the Palestinians.	我是中文句子
Israel was not born, and it is not Israel’s destiny, to govern another people.	我是中文句子
We are sincerely interested in the establishment of a Palestinian state living peacefully side-by-side with Israel, the democratic state of the Jewish people.	我是中文句子
The international community can support these efforts by providing incentives to countries that choose freedom and progress.	我是中文句子
At the same time, determined and decisive policies must be taken against extremists.	我是中文句子
Iran also uses proxies to instigate terror against moderate forces in the Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, and Iraq.	我是中文句子
If Iran is successful in its plan to acquire nuclear weapons, its leaders could shake the Middle East and encourage more extremism and violence.	我是中文句子
Israel will defend itself if Iran continues to call for its destruction.	我是中文句子
However, the threat is not to Israel alone; Iran is a danger to the peace and stability of the entire world.	我是中文句子
Beyond the short-term challenges ahead, we all have a duty to profoundly change the way we prepare our children to cope with today’s new world.	我是中文句子
In an era where yesterday has become almost irrelevant and we can hardly predict tomorrow, the role of education must allow all children to reach their highest potential.	我是中文句子
Today’s educators should inspire our children towards creativity and innovation.	我是中文句子
Self-expression is as important as free expression.	我是中文句子
I write this in the 88th year of my life, but not because I have learned from experience.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, experience is overrated, often constraining the courage needed to face tomorrow and build an unprecedented new world.	我是中文句子
The future is already here; there is no point in looking back.	我是中文句子
Against Simplification	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – It is said that Americans have a genius for simplification.	我是中文句子
Gradually, however, the quest for it has become a global trend, one that continues to conquer new territories, just as blue jeans once did.	我是中文句子
The tyranny of pragmatism seems to mark all of the complex dilemmas of our time.	我是中文句子
Too many valid choices are ignored or skirted through the routine of short-cuts.	我是中文句子
Nowhere is this trend more damaging than in today’s mercantile approach to art.	我是中文句子
The theme, style, and echo of his work says a lot, I think, about our simplified world.	我是中文句子
Hailed in Europe as one of the great novels of the twentieth century, Blinding arrived in America only after a great delay, and never received the attention that it deserved.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, that is no surprise.	我是中文句子
The number of literary translations done nowadays in the United States is, according to a United Nations report, equal to that of Greece, a country one-tenth the size.	我是中文句子
They are imprisoned for their Stalinist allegiance; when they are finally allowed to return to Italy, their old comrades refuse to accept them.	我是中文句子
The book’s plot spans two centuries of revolution.	我是中文句子
Then, suddenly,	我是中文句子
How can you go home again if the sea has been sucked down a vast drain that opened up beneath it, emptying it who knows where, into a void?	我是中文句子
The earth is arid and dead, but there won’t be another one, nor another heaven.”	我是中文句子
Are all the extremists searching for a new coherence, for a lost illusion of togetherness and a new hope of resurrection?	我是中文句子
Can we ever forget September 11, 2001, the start of a bloody century in which the mystical force of hatred and destruction has recovered its strength?	我是中文句子
Is this the “rebel” response to an overly globalized, incoherent, and ultimately disturbing reality?	我是中文句子
The new religious militants, fighting in the name of their particular and peculiar God, seem as fanaticized as the Fascists, Nazis, and Communists of earlier decades.	我是中文句子
It is also a rich and original literary achievement that challenges today’s consumerist ethic.	我是中文句子
An Agenda for Resolving the US-China Conflict	我是中文句子
The alternatives pose grave risks for both countries: an ever-escalating trade war, a cold war, or even a hot war.	我是中文句子
These risks can be avoided, but only if both leaders are willing to engage in principled compromise.	我是中文句子
There is no question that a serious conflict has been building for a long time.	我是中文句子
Contrary to the US narrative, the problem is not the outsize bilateral trade deficit between the world’s two largest economies.	我是中文句子
That is largely an outgrowth of macroeconomic imbalances that afflict both sides: China saves too much and the US saves too little.	我是中文句子
These saving disparities give rise to multilateral trade imbalances that cannot be resolved by bilateral efforts.	我是中文句子
For the US, this would lead to higher-cost imports – the functional equivalent of a tax hike on consumers.	我是中文句子
For China, it would spell increased export penetration into other markets.	我是中文句子
Fixation on the blame game of bilateral trade imbalances overlooks the possibility that this is a classic struggle of codependency.	我是中文句子
Yes, China has long relied on the US as the major source of external demand for its export-led economy.	我是中文句子
And, as America’s third largest and most rapidly growing export market, China has become an increasingly important source of demand for US firms.	我是中文句子
The codependency framework is important because it underscores the need for joint resolution and compromise.	我是中文句子
As in interpersonal relationships, economic codependency can be destabilizing and ultimately destructive.	我是中文句子
When one partner changes course, the other, feeling scorned, lashes out in response.	我是中文句子
At the same time, China is also moving from surplus saving to saving absorption, leaving it less to lend to its deficit partner, the US.	我是中文句子
Uncomfortable in its own skin, the US feels threatened by a partner that is changing the rules of this relationship.	我是中文句子
At a time of ever-escalating threats and counter-threats, the imperative of compromise cannot be understated.	我是中文句子
Four possible avenues to consider:	我是中文句子
Market access: After ten years of tortuous negotiations, the time for a breakthrough on a US-China bilateral investment treaty (BIT) is at hand.	我是中文句子
Both sides would need to offer concessions.	我是中文句子
Saving: Both countries need to commit to responsible macroeconomic adjustments.	我是中文句子
The US needs to save more, reversing the reckless budget-busting trajectory reinforced by last year’s ill-timed, outsize tax cuts.	我是中文句子
Rebuilding saving, rather than tariffs, is the most effective strategy to reduce trade deficits with China or any other trading partner.	我是中文句子
Dialogue: It is terrific that the two presidents are meeting again after their earlier tête-à-têtes in Beijing and at Mar-a-Lago.	我是中文句子
Those gatherings follow more formal engagements such as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue.	我是中文句子
But all of these efforts have been episodic events that are long on glitz and short on substance.	我是中文句子
In light of contentious recent developments between the US and China, it is hard to be optimistic that a meaningful breakthrough is at hand.	我是中文句子
An agenda of substance should be used as a checklist against any accord that may be struck by Trump and Xi.	我是中文句子
The world is watching.	我是中文句子
The Age of Hyper-Uncertainty	我是中文句子
Forty years is a long time, but it is worth looking back and reminding ourselves of how much Galbraith and his readers had to be uncertain about.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, efforts to rebuild the Bretton Woods international monetary system had collapsed, casting a shadow over prospects for international trade and global economic growth.	我是中文句子
That’s how things looked in 1977, anyway.	我是中文句子
Viewed from the perspective of 2017, however, the uncertainty of 1977 seems almost enviable.	我是中文句子
In 1977, there was no President Donald Trump.	我是中文句子
Jimmy Carter may not go down in history as one of the best US presidents, but he did not threaten actions that placed the entire global system at risk.	我是中文句子
He did not turn his back on America’s international commitments such as NATO and the World Trade Organization.	我是中文句子
Nor did Carter go to war with the Federal Reserve or pack its board with sympathetic appointees willing to sacrifice sound money to his reelection prospects.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, he appointed Paul Volcker, a towering pillar of monetary stability, as chairman of the Board of Governors.	我是中文句子
And although Carter did not succeed in balancing the federal budget, he didn’t blow it up, either.	我是中文句子
Conceivable outcomes range from mildly reassuring to utterly catastrophic.	我是中文句子
Who knows what will happen?	我是中文句子
By today’s standards, Carter was the embodiment of predictability.	我是中文句子
In 1977, moreover, the prospects for European integration were rosy.	我是中文句子
Denmark, Ireland, and, most notably, the United Kingdom had recently joined a rapidly growing European Community.	我是中文句子
The EC was attracting members, not losing them.	我是中文句子
It was a club that countries sought to join precisely in order to achieve faster economic growth.	我是中文句子
Moreover, to buttress its common market, the EC had just established a regional monetary system, the suggestively named “snake in the tunnel.”	我是中文句子
In 2017, in contrast, negotiations over Brexit will continue to cast a dark cloud of uncertainty over the European Union.	我是中文句子
How those negotiations will proceed and how long they will take are anyone’s guess.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile Europe’s monetary house remains half built.	我是中文句子
The eurozone is neither appealing enough to attract additional members nor flexible enough to grant troubled incumbents a temporary holiday, in the manner of the currency snake. The euro will likely survive the year, inertia being what it is.	我是中文句子
In 1977, uncertainties emanating from emerging markets were not on commentators’ radar screens.	我是中文句子
Developing countries in Latin America and East Asia were growing, although they depended increasingly on a drip feed of foreign loans from money-center banks.	我是中文句子
China, still largely cut off from the world, did not figure in this discussion.	我是中文句子
And even if something went wrong in the Third World, developing countries were simply too small to drag down the global economy.	我是中文句子
The situation today couldn’t be more different.	我是中文句子
What happens in China, Brazil, or Turkey doesn’t stay in China, Brazil, or Turkey.	我是中文句子
China has an unmanageable corporate-debt problem and a government whose commitment to restructuring the economy is uncertain.	我是中文句子
Turkey has a massive current-account deficit, an erratic president, and an unstable geopolitical neighborhood.	我是中文句子
And if political scandals were export goods, Brazil would have a clear comparative advantage.	我是中文句子
Although The Age of Uncertainty was about much more than the year 1977, it captured the tenor of the times.	我是中文句子
But if Galbraith were writing the same book in 2017, he probably would call the 1970s The Age of Assurance.	我是中文句子
A German Europe?	我是中文句子
LISBON/RIGA – Is the Europe that is emerging from the euro crisis a German one?	我是中文句子
During the euro crisis, power in the European Union seems to have shifted towards national capitals in general, and towards one national capital in particular: Berlin.	我是中文句子
But, with Germany introverted, France downgraded, and Britain semi-detached, the big story in European foreign policy is that the time has come for the little guy who thinks big.	我是中文句子
In this Europe, the important moves are now sometimes made in Stockholm or Warsaw, not only in Berlin, Paris, or London.	我是中文句子
Germany, in foreign policy as well as in economics, can exert decisive leadership in the EU – when it wants to.	我是中文句子
For example, together with Poland, it led the EU’s attempt to develop a coordinated approach to Russia, and it flexed its muscles on Serbia.	我是中文句子
But, on other issues – for example, Libya – Germany did not so much lead as use its newfound room for maneuver to follow its own preferences in the face of other EU members.	我是中文句子
So the answer today to Henry Kissinger’s famous question about whom he should call when he wants to speak to Europe, is not necessarily “the German chancellor.”	我是中文句子
Moreover, Germany, it seems, is becoming a “geo-economic power” driven by the needs of its export sector.	我是中文句子
By using economic means to pursue its foreign-policy ends, Germany is gradually turning its back on its European partners.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, as France experiences a loss of power relative to Germany on economic issues, it continues to play a decisive role in foreign policy.	我是中文句子
France led the Libya operation, and is doing much the same with attempts to impose stronger sanctions against Iran and provide support for the United Nations in Côte d’Ivoire.	我是中文句子
But France’s unilateral approach often antagonizes its European partners.	我是中文句子
For example, French President Nicolas Sarkozy preempted a common European position on the Palestinian statehood bid at the UN in September.	我是中文句子
In other words, even when France leads, it does not always do so in a constructive way.	我是中文句子
Apart from the decisive role that it played in Libya alongside France, Britain is becoming increasingly marginal in European foreign policymaking.	我是中文句子
On other issues, such as engaging “strategic partners” – China and Russia in particular – the United Kingdom is often a follower as well.	我是中文句子
As the “big three” increasingly pursue their own narrowly defined national interests, however, other EU member states are emerging as leaders in key foreign-policy fields.	我是中文句子
Poland, too, is emerging as a foreign-policy leader.	我是中文句子
Poland has also led on European defense (though it declined to take part in the military intervention in Libya).	我是中文句子
This reflects the strength of the Polish economy, which is expected to grow by more than 3% in 2012 – faster than almost anywhere else in the EU.	我是中文句子
For example, on Iran (with exceptions like Greece), Europeans have united around a clear policy and collective positions, such as an oil embargo.	我是中文句子
So, Poland and Sweden:  Europe needs your leadership.	我是中文句子
But that might not be enough in an EU with more than 500 million citizens.	我是中文句子
Other EU states need to follow their example in order to make European foreign policy truly effective and influential.	我是中文句子
A German Glimmer in a Global Boom	我是中文句子
But the boom is not uniform.	我是中文句子
However, in the Asian countries, including China, the optimism is unbroken.	我是中文句子
The same is true for Eastern Europe, the ex-Soviet states, and Latin America.	我是中文句子
The big surprise is Europe, which, unlike in 2004 and the first half of 2005, now seems to be catching up with the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
To be sure, economic performance will vary widely among EU countries.	我是中文句子
But even Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is experiencing an upswing.	我是中文句子
After five years of stagnation, the economy is finally on the move.	我是中文句子
The driving force is external demand, as Germany, the world’s second-largest exporter, profits from the global boom.	我是中文句子
Exports increased by 6.2% in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2006.	我是中文句子
The good news for Germany is that investment demand is now growing, too.	我是中文句子
While the second half of 2005 was already quite good, Ifo expects investment in equipment to grow by a healthy 6% in 2006.	我是中文句子
After many years of contraction, investment in construction also will rise slightly.	我是中文句子
That number looks small compared to most other countries.	我是中文句子
In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster.	我是中文句子
Measured against a disappointing past, even Germany is currently experiencing an economic boom.	我是中文句子
The real test for the German government is the labor market.	我是中文句子
Most observers now agree that Germany needs something like the American earned-income tax credit.	我是中文句子
That would widen the wage distribution, create jobs, and maintain the living standard of the poor.	我是中文句子
Merkel announced in her inaugural speech in the Bundestag that her government will introduce such a system in 2006.	我是中文句子
In the long term, that would be more promising for the EU – and for the global economy – than the demand-driven performance that Germany is currently enjoying.	我是中文句子
Is Pensioner Populism Here to Stay?	我是中文句子
MILAN – The right-wing populism that has emerged in many Western democracies in recent years could turn out to be much more than a blip on the political landscape.	我是中文句子
It turns out that older voters are rather sympathetic to nationalist movements.	我是中文句子
Older Britons voted disproportionately in favor of leaving the European Union, and older Americans delivered the US presidency to Donald Trump.	我是中文句子
Neither the Law and Justice (PiS) party in Poland nor Fidesz in Hungary would be in power without the enthusiastic support of the elderly.	我是中文句子
And in Italy, the League has succeeded in large part by exploiting the discontent of Northern Italy’s seniors.	我是中文句子
Next spring, this age-driven voting pattern could drive the outcome of the European Parliament election.	我是中文句子
This is surprising, given that memories of World War II and its legacy should be fresher for older generations.	我是中文句子
Nevertheless, their skepticism toward democratic EU institutions may explain their receptiveness to authoritarian leaders.	我是中文句子
Most likely, a growing sense of insecurity is pushing the elderly into the populists’ arms.	我是中文句子
For example, immigration tends to instill more fear in older voters, because they are usually more attached to traditional values and self-contained communities.	我是中文句子
Likewise, globalization and technological progress often disrupt traditional or legacy industries, where older workers are more likely to be employed.	我是中文句子
The rise of the digital economy, dominated by people in their twenties and thirties, is also pushing older workers to the margins.	我是中文句子
Moreover, pensioners now have reason to worry about threats to their retirement benefits from their own children.	我是中文句子
Young people, frustrated with socioeconomic systems that are clearly tilted in favor of retirees, are increasingly calling for fairer intergenerational redistribution of scarce resources.	我是中文句子
So, while right-wing populists have attracted older voters, left-wing populist have gained a following among younger generations.	我是中文句子
By backing right-wing populists, older voters hope to return to a time when domestic affairs were insulated from global forces and national borders were less porous.	我是中文句子
At the heart of today’s nationalist politics is a promise to preserve the status quo – or even to restore a mythical past.	我是中文句子
Hence, nationalist politicians often resort to nostalgic rhetoric to mobilize their older supporters.	我是中文句子
For his part, Trump has pledged to bring back jobs in the American Rust Belt, once the center of US manufacturing.	我是中文句子
Likewise, there could be no clearer symbol of resistance to change than his proposed wall on the US-Mexico border.	我是中文句子
And his crackdown on illegal immigration and ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries signals his commitment to a “pure” American nation.	我是中文句子
Similarly, in continental Europe, right-wing populists want to return to a time before the adoption of the euro and the Schengen system of passport-free travel within most of the EU.	我是中文句子
And they often appeal directly to older voters by promising to lower the retirement age and expand pension benefits (both are flagship policies of the League).	我是中文句子
In the United Kingdom, the “Leave” campaign promised vindication for those who have been left behind in the age of globalization.	我是中文句子
Never mind that it also touted the idea of a free and independent “Global Britain.”	我是中文句子
The Brexiteers are not known for their consistency.	我是中文句子
At any rate, to the extent that today’s populist wave is driven by demographics, it is not likely to crest anytime soon.	我是中文句子
In graying societies, the political clout of the elderly will steadily grow; and in rapidly changing economies, their ability to adapt will decline.	我是中文句子
As a result, older voters will demand more and more socioeconomic security, and irresponsible populists will be waiting in the wings to accommodate them.	我是中文句子
Can anything be done?	我是中文句子
To stem the nationalist tide, mainstream parties urgently need to devise a new social compact that addresses the mounting sense of insecurity among older voters.	我是中文句子
The answer is not to suffocate global forces, but to render them more tolerable.	我是中文句子
Citizens of all ages need to be equipped to face current and future disruptions.	我是中文句子
And besides, a policy that makes people reliant on some form of external support is morally questionable, at best.	我是中文句子
Subsidies to the most vulnerable should remain a last resort.	我是中文句子
In many ways, older voters’ infatuation with populists is a cry for help.	我是中文句子
It is up to enlightened politicians to respond to it constructively.	我是中文句子
A Global Agenda for Seven Billion	我是中文句子
And our numbers keep growing, with corresponding pressures on land, energy, food, and water. The global economy is generating pressures as well: rising joblessness, widening social inequalities, and the emergence of new economic powers.	我是中文句子
The 66th session of the UN General Assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow, short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity’s long-term imperatives.	我是中文句子
In the next five years, we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and forge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement.	我是中文句子
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity.	我是中文句子
We know how to do this.	我是中文句子
Our record proves it – in Guinea, Kenya, and Kyrgyzstan.	我是中文句子
A third imperative is building a safer and more secure world. In this effort, we must be courageous in standing up for democracy, human rights, and peace.	我是中文句子
In the Middle East, we must break the stalemate.	我是中文句子
Palestinians deserve a state.	我是中文句子
Israel needs security.	我是中文句子
Both want peace. A negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes, and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace.	我是中文句子
The fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition.	我是中文句子
This year’s dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East inspired people around the globe.	我是中文句子
Let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all.	我是中文句子
Syria is a special concern.	我是中文句子
For six months we have seen escalating violence and repression.	我是中文句子
The government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people. It has not done so.	我是中文句子
The moment to act is now.	我是中文句子
The violence must stop.	我是中文句子
Last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people.	我是中文句子
Women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world’s unrealized potential.	我是中文句子
We need their full engagement – in government, business, and civil society.	我是中文句子
Seven billion people now look toward the United Nations for solutions to the world’s great global challenges.	我是中文句子
They hold different religions and backgrounds but common dreams and aspirations.	我是中文句子
Our global future depends on bringing these individual talents and universal rights together in common cause.	我是中文句子
Let our common agenda begin.	我是中文句子
A Global Consensus Against Terrorism	我是中文句子
But there is much more going on at the UN than investigations.	我是中文句子
Some of the reform talk concerns the UN Security Council’s composition.	我是中文句子
The Security Council represents what the World War II Allies believed the post-war world would look like and how it should be run.	我是中文句子
Defending the Security Council’s current make-up is impossible; the need for change is beyond debate.	我是中文句子
But coming up with an approach that gains broad international support will prove extremely difficult.	我是中文句子
Clearly, fixing the Security Council will require considerable time and political effort.	我是中文句子
This will prove more difficult than it first sounds.	我是中文句子
Historians have the luxury of debating whether terrorism may have been justified in certain situations in the past.	我是中文句子
We do not.	我是中文句子
Modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated, much less supported.	我是中文句子
Terrorism is even less justified given that political avenues exist nowadays for pursuing political aims.	我是中文句子
Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and can count on American, Russian, European, and UN assistance.	我是中文句子
Iraqis have elected their own representatives and are poised to write their constitution.	我是中文句子
No one pursuing reasonable goals and who is prepared to compromise can argue that terrorism is his or his group’s only option.	我是中文句子
The world has already taken some important steps against terrorism.	我是中文句子
A dozen international conventions and numerous UN resolutions commit governments to oppose hostage taking, the hijacking of civilian aircraft, and terrorism more broadly.	我是中文句子
What is missing is a new, 13th convention that closes the loophole that seems to permit governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not.	我是中文句子
Of course, such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism.	我是中文句子
But ideas matter.	我是中文句子
Terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been.	我是中文句子
We are taught early on in our lives that the end cannot justify the means.	我是中文句子
It is time to put this principle into effect before many more innocent lives are lost.	我是中文句子
A Global Green New Deal	我是中文句子
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate, as well as inter-generational, proportions.	我是中文句子
In the past, concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury; today, it is a necessity – a point grasped by some, but by no means all, economic architects yet.	我是中文句子
The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times.	我是中文句子
The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies.	我是中文句子
Similar pro-employment “Green New Deal” packages have been lined up in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.	我是中文句子
In South Africa, the government-backed Working for Water initiative – which employs more than 30,000 people, including women, youth, and the disabled – also sees opportunity in crisis.	我是中文句子
The country spends roughly $60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife, water supplies, important tourism destinations, and farmland.	我是中文句子
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel.	我是中文句子
As a result, an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity, equal to 2% of the country’s electricity needs, will be generated, along with more than 5,000 jobs.	我是中文句子
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery.	我是中文句子
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80% of Africans who have no access to electricity.	我是中文句子
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit.	我是中文句子
The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008, responds to the current economic malaise.	我是中文句子
A Global Growth Bargain	我是中文句子
LONDON – US President Barack Obama caught the imagination of the world when he talked recently of a new “Sputnik moment.”	我是中文句子
Yet Asia’s growth also gives the West unprecedented economic hope.	我是中文句子
The world’s middle class will have swelled from one billion consumers to three billion.	我是中文句子
The opportunities for growth in Europe and the US from this additional global demand are enormous.	我是中文句子
The countries and companies that will flourish in Asia’s new markets will be those that can provide the technology-driven, custom-built, high value-added goods and services needed to serve Asia’s two billion consumers.	我是中文句子
But neither Europe nor the US is in a strong enough position to take best advantage of these new markets.	我是中文句子
I believe that such an agreement could boost the world economy by around 3% by 2014 – and lift 100 million people out of poverty.	我是中文句子
I presented this plan when I chaired the G-20 in London in 2009.	我是中文句子
Our attention was focused on preventing recession from turning into depression.	我是中文句子
I argued that this was also the moment to pioneer a more lasting framework of growth.	我是中文句子
In the end, no agreement was possible on a shared growth objective, and there has not yet been enough political will for the coordinated action to achieve it.	我是中文句子
The global growth agreement that evaded us in 2009 remains the unfinished work of the G-20.	我是中文句子
Front-loaded public investment could be funded through an enhanced European Investment Bank.	我是中文句子
If other Asian countries do likewise, and agree to create a level playing field for exporters, we could create around 50 million additional jobs.	我是中文句子
Of course, in the West, an investment plan invites criticism from those who prefer that we do nothing but talk about growth strategies.	我是中文句子
Indeed, critics argue that raising public investment conflicts with the drive to reduce deficits, and warn of higher interest rates on the back of further spending.	我是中文句子
But critics are wrong about the impact on the deficit of focused investment.	我是中文句子
My extrapolation of the IMF model shows that Western countries can boost their long-term GDP growth significantly by increasing their levels of capital investment over a three-year period.	我是中文句子
It also underscores the importance of the G-20 and the IMF in seeking global consensus now.	我是中文句子
The West is well placed to play its part in global renewal.	我是中文句子
Its extraordinary workforces produce world-class goods and services.	我是中文句子
But the West’s workforce must not be condemned to policies that willfully produce a decade of slow growth and low employment.	我是中文句子
That would be a human tragedy, not just an economic disaster.	我是中文句子
A Global Perfect Storm	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Dark, lowering financial and economic clouds are, it seems, rolling in from every direction: the eurozone, the United States, China, and elsewhere.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shelter.	我是中文句子
Moreover, fiscal and sovereign-debt strains are becoming worse as interest-rate spreads for Spain and Italy have returned to their unsustainable peak levels.	我是中文句子
Farther to the west, US economic performance is weakening, with first-quarter growth a miserly 1.9% – well below potential.	我是中文句子
And job creation faltered in April and May, so the US may reach stall speed by year end.	我是中文句子
Moreover, political gridlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to persist, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins November’s presidential election.	我是中文句子
At the same time, the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets, together with their move towards greater state capitalism, is hampering growth and will reduce their resiliency.	我是中文句子
Finally, long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other on the issue of nuclear proliferation could reach a boil by 2013.	我是中文句子
The current negotiations are likely to fail, and even tightened sanctions may not stop Iran from trying to build nuclear weapons.	我是中文句子
These risks are already exacerbating the economic slowdown: equity markets are falling everywhere, leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending.	我是中文句子
Borrowing costs are rising for highly indebted sovereigns, credit rationing is undermining small and medium-size companies, and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries’ income.	我是中文句子
Increasing risk aversion is leading economic agents to adopt a wait-and-see stance that makes the slowdown partly self-fulfilling.	我是中文句子
Monetary policy is constrained by the proximity to zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing.	我是中文句子
Indeed, economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems, but rather credit and insolvency crises.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus.	我是中文句子
After all, a weaker currency and better trade balance in some countries necessarily implies a stronger currency and a weaker trade balance in others.	我是中文句子
As a result, sovereign risk is now becoming banking risk.	我是中文句子
Indeed, sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks’ balance sheet, especially in the eurozone.	我是中文句子
As a result, the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising.	我是中文句子
And, while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst, it is not the only one threatening the global economy.	我是中文句子
Batten down the hatches.	我是中文句子
A Global Solutions Network	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Great social change occurs in several ways.	我是中文句子
A technological breakthrough – the steam engine, computers, the Internet – may play a leading role.	我是中文句子
Visionaries, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela, may inspire a demand for justice.	我是中文句子
Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement, as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.	我是中文句子
Our own generation urgently needs to spur another era of great social change.	我是中文句子
This time, we must act to save the planet from a human-induced environmental catastrophe.	我是中文句子
Each of us senses this challenge almost daily.	我是中文句子
Our $70-trillion-per-year global economy is putting unprecedented pressures on the natural environment.	我是中文句子
We will need new technologies, behaviors, and ethics, supported by solid evidence, to reconcile further economic development with environmental sustainability.	我是中文句子
In the past two decades, governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats.	我是中文句子
Politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit.	我是中文句子
To empower global society to act, Ban has launched a bold new global initiative, for which I am grateful to volunteer.	我是中文句子
The idea is to use global networks of knowledge and action to identify and demonstrate new, cutting-edge approaches to sustainable development around the world.	我是中文句子
The network will work alongside and support governments, UN agencies, civil-society organizations, and the private sector.	我是中文句子
But time is running very short.	我是中文句子
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increased climate volatility.	我是中文句子
Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network.	我是中文句子
Today, we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies face the challenges of poverty reduction, clean energy, sustainable food supplies, and the rest.	我是中文句子
The world’s corporate sector also has a significant role to play in sustainable development.	我是中文句子
Now the corporate sector has two faces.	我是中文句子
It is the repository of cutting-edge sustainable technologies, pioneering research and development, world-class management, and leadership in environmental sustainability.	我是中文句子
Yet at the same time, the corporate sector lobbies aggressively to gut environmental regulations, slash corporate-tax rates, and avoid their own responsibility for ecological destruction.	我是中文句子
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide.	我是中文句子
We urgently need far-sighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.	我是中文句子
These companies are uniquely placed to move new ideas and technologies into early-stage demonstration projects, thereby accelerating global learning cycles.	我是中文句子
Sustainable development is a generational challenge, not a short-term task.	我是中文句子
The reinvention of energy, food, transport, and other systems will take decades, not years.	我是中文句子
But the long-term nature of this challenge must not lull us into inaction.	我是中文句子
We must start reinventing our productive systems now, precisely because the path of change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already so pressing.	我是中文句子
In the post-2015 era, the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand, reinforcing each other.	我是中文句子
The Secretary General’s launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network is therefore especially timely.	我是中文句子
Not only will the world adopt a new set of goals to achieve sustainable development, but it will also have a new global network of expertise to help achieve those vital objectives.	我是中文句子
A Good Rate Hike for Europe	我是中文句子
Two wrongs don’t make a right.	我是中文句子
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents’ tables doesn’t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone.	我是中文句子
That may sound obvious, but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating.	我是中文句子
Who’s he kidding?	我是中文句子
If anyone is “pushing down on the Italian growth brake” it is Berlusconi himself.	我是中文句子
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy’s lame economic performance.	我是中文句子
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy.	我是中文句子
More than the usual “blame game” is at work here.	我是中文句子
Soaring energy prices, for example, have become a leading inflation risk.	我是中文句子
But higher energy prices, by themselves, will not cause the ECB to pull the interest-rate trigger.	我是中文句子
The key will be so-called “second-round effects” – whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions.	我是中文句子
So far, the “social partners,” as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions, have been quiet.	我是中文句子
Should this change, the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe’s economic growth remains slack.	我是中文句子
The good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up (even in Italy).	我是中文句子
How will the ECB react to better economic news?	我是中文句子
Some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low, at 2%, for so long (more than two years).	我是中文句子
True, there is no inflation problem in the short run, but the ECB’s monetary policy focuses on the medium term.	我是中文句子
One particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB’s benchmark level, indicating an excess supply of liquidity.	我是中文句子
It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question.	我是中文句子
Interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later, which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, in Germany, the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy.	我是中文句子
Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrats’ candidate, is a reformer, holding out hope for Germany’s future – and that of Europe.	我是中文句子
This would be bad news for the German economy, which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes.	我是中文句子
On the other hand, a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action.	我是中文句子
This raises an interesting point.	我是中文句子
A hike, in other words, would indicate that good things are happening.	我是中文句子
But the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth.	我是中文句子
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth.	我是中文句子
A Good Year for God	我是中文句子
LONDON – It’s been a better year for God.	我是中文句子
Best of all has been The Case for God by the brilliant religion writer Karen Armstrong.	我是中文句子
More important still is the news that more people (certainly in Britain) are going to Christian churches of all denominations.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the Pope made a very successful visit to Britain in September.	我是中文句子
We know already about heavy attendance at the country’s mosques.	我是中文句子
At this time of year, of course, many Christians who are not regular churchgoers attend the Nativity services.	我是中文句子
Carols, church bells, and mangers are still at the heart of mid-winter festivities, alongside the consumer binge.	我是中文句子
This year, however, the “big spend” in Europe may have been inhibited by the big winter freeze and the big austerity programs across most of the continent.	我是中文句子
Even in the most Godless households, most children in Western societies probably know the details of the Christmas story.	我是中文句子
The travelers who can find no room at the inn.	我是中文句子
The birth of a baby in the stables.	我是中文句子
The arrival of the wise men bearing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.	我是中文句子
We learn about all this at the same time as we are told about Father Christmas, his Lapland reindeers, and his sacks full of presents.	我是中文句子
We rapidly lose our belief in that winter myth.	我是中文句子
But we tend to retain into adulthood the same views of God that we formed in childhood.	我是中文句子
An old man with a long beard watches over us, and most of us retain a pretty literal opinion of the stories about his Son told in the Bible’s New Testament.	我是中文句子
It is this God that atheists like Dawkins and Hitchens attack.	我是中文句子
And, with such a target, it is not very difficult to poke holes and pile on the ridicule.	我是中文句子
To them the world was made in six days; evolution is a fanciful tale.	我是中文句子
And there are Muslims who ignore the Koran’s commands of pluralism, tolerance, and peace.	我是中文句子
Where the atheist assault is often correct is in pinpointing the amount of harm frequently done in our world by such fundamentalists.	我是中文句子
Right-wing American attitudes about their country’s place in the world are invigorated by fundamentalist dogma.	我是中文句子
The United Nations is the devil’s own creation.	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama is an un-American Muslim.	我是中文句子
Palestine from the Jordan River to the coast should be handed to Israel so that the world can end with a cataclysmic Christian triumph.	我是中文句子
Jewish fundamentalists obstruct any peace process that is left in the Middle East and build more illegal settlements.	我是中文句子
Islamic fundamentalists define jihad as a war of terror against the West and call for an Islamic caliphate from the Atlantic to the Pacific.	我是中文句子
Christian fundamentalism in America harks back to nineteenth-century populism and anti-intellectualism.	我是中文句子
Members of evangelical churches associate their beliefs with the rugged individualism of the early pioneers.	我是中文句子
They are contemptuous of the establishment.	我是中文句子
That is the most important message for everyone, atheists included, to take from the Christian story of Christmas.	我是中文句子
A Gravity Test for the Euro	我是中文句子
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments’ latest “comprehensive package” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months?	我是中文句子
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding.	我是中文句子
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism?	我是中文句子
Let’s begin with why the euro needs to fall.	我是中文句子
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign (junk) bonds.	我是中文句子
Either way, the threat of a profound financial crisis is high.	我是中文句子
Given this, what arguments support the current value of the euro, or its further rise?	我是中文句子
First, investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario, the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro.	我是中文句子
But, while this scenario has a certain ring of truth, surely any breakup would be highly traumatic, with the euro diving before its rump form recovered.	我是中文句子
Although it may be difficult to connect the dots, it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere.	我是中文句子
Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies.	我是中文句子
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors.	我是中文句子
Fourth, investors may believe that, ultimately, US risks are just as large as Europe’s.	我是中文句子
True, the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits.	我是中文句子
Moreover, investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of “quantitative easing,” which would further drive down the dollar.	我是中文句子
For the eurozone’s southern periphery, however, today’s euro rate is very difficult to manage.	我是中文句子
But, because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone’s north and south, one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range.	我是中文句子
Finally, investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders’ latest plan will work, even though the last dozen plans have failed.	我是中文句子
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”	我是中文句子
A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time, but not for all of the countries anytime soon.	我是中文句子
But don’t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead.	我是中文句子
A Green Alternative to Austerity?	我是中文句子
One idea is that environmental technology might feed a virtuous cycle of innovation and employment.	我是中文句子
To some, green growth evokes a countryside covered with windmills and urban roofs lined with solar panels.	我是中文句子
But it is broader than that.	我是中文句子
Still, it is easier to find exciting anecdotes than it is to show how they scale up to revitalizing an entire economy.	我是中文句子
Moreover, there is a great diversity of narratives on the green economy – and their proliferation is likely to grow.	我是中文句子
The European Climate Foundation had already published its Roadmap 2050, A Practical Guide to a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Europe.	我是中文句子
All take somewhat different approaches and offer different recommendations, making it hard for policymakers to see the forest through the trees.	我是中文句子
And, at the root of this multiplicity of perspectives lays the fact that economics struggles to explain how growth and innovation move an economy as a whole.	我是中文句子
Yet, the studies of green growth mentioned above all appear to provide such explanations.	我是中文句子
So, what do they really tell us?	我是中文句子
In practice, each is limited to just one or two aspects of the economy, and describes how these interact.	我是中文句子
Growing Green and Decent Jobs looks at the relationship between investment and jobs.	我是中文句子
A New Growth Path for Europe examines the impact of expectations and learning-by-doing.	我是中文句子
Roadmap 2050 focuses on greening the power system.	我是中文句子
The authors then make a leap of faith to derive conclusions about the economy as a whole.	我是中文句子
That said, the fact that one cannot prove conclusively how green growth would work does not mean that we should give up on the idea.	我是中文句子
We know from history that waves of innovation, from the steam engine to the information and communications revolution, have led to dramatic increases in economic growth.	我是中文句子
We cannot prove that a wave of environmental innovation will have a similar effect, but the studies of the parts make such an outcome highly plausible.	我是中文句子
As humans, we are uniquely equipped to make decisions on the basis of ambiguous information – in fact, we do it all the time.	我是中文句子
A big pile of green-growth reports demonstrates the plausibility of this path to recovery from an historic economic crisis.	我是中文句子
It is now up to us to realize its potential.	我是中文句子
Green growth offers a realistic alternative to the faltering austerity approach to overcoming the current economic crisis.	我是中文句子
Policymakers should incorporate this thinking into the “beyond austerity” narrative that is taking shape in a growing number of key EU member states.	我是中文句子
Ethics and Agriculture	我是中文句子
MELBOURNE – Should rich countries – or investors based there – be buying agricultural land in developing countries?	我是中文句子
This amounts to 1.7% of the world’s agricultural land.	我是中文句子
Most of these purchases have been made in Africa, with two-thirds taking place in countries where hunger is widespread and institutions for establishing formal land ownership are often weak.	我是中文句子
The purchases in Africa alone amount to an area of agricultural land the size of Kenya.	我是中文句子
It has been claimed that foreign investors are purchasing land that has been left idle; thus, by bringing it into production, the purchases are increasing the availability of food overall.	我是中文句子
On average, per capita income in the countries that are the source of these investments is four times higher than in the target countries.	我是中文句子
More than 40% of such projects aim to export food to the source country – suggesting that food security is a major reason for buying the land.	我是中文句子
Oxfam International calls some of these deals “land grabs.”	我是中文句子
Oxfam also wants the Bank to ensure that these land deals do not undermine either local or national food security.	我是中文句子
The Bank rejected the idea of a moratorium on its own work with investors in agriculture, arguing that this would target precisely those who are most likely to do the right thing.	我是中文句子
One may ask whether transparency and the requirement that local landholders consent to a sale is enough to protect people living in poverty.	我是中文句子
Supporters of free markets will argue that if local landowners wish to sell their land, that is their choice to make.	我是中文句子
After all, we do not allow poor people to sell their kidneys to the highest bidder.	我是中文句子
Of course, hardline supporters of free markets will say that we should.	我是中文句子
But, at the very least, it needs to be explained why people should be prohibited from selling kidneys, but not from selling the land that grows their food.	我是中文句子
Most people can live without one kidney.	我是中文句子
No one can live without food.	我是中文句子
The World Bank may indeed be more concerned about local landholders’ rights than other foreign investors are.	我是中文句子
One such case belatedly came to the attention of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.	我是中文句子
Are we to believe that landholders fare better with Chinese or Saudi investors?	我是中文句子
The Rise of the Food Barons	我是中文句子
And yet the sector has taken virtually no steps to improve quality and sustainability, or to promote social justice.	我是中文句子
Given the high profits and vast political power of these companies, changes to the status quo are not in their interest.	我是中文句子
Moreover, market concentration in the agriculture sector is on the rise, owing to increased demand for the agricultural raw materials needed in food, animal feed, and energy production.	我是中文句子
The biggest players in these sectors have been buying out their smaller competitors for years.	我是中文句子
But now they are also buying out one another, often with financing provided by investors from completely different sectors.	我是中文句子
“Baysanto” alone would be the proprietor of almost every genetically modified plant on the planet.	我是中文句子
With other large mergers also being announced, the global agriculture market at the end of 2017 could look very different than it did at the beginning.	我是中文句子
The agrotechnical sector is experiencing some of the same changes as the seed sector.	我是中文句子
The most promising new opportunity for food corporations today lies in the digitization of agriculture.	我是中文句子
This process is still in its early stages, but it is gathering momentum, and eventually it will cover all areas of production.	我是中文句子
To maximize the benefits of these new technologies, the companies that already dominate the value chain have begun cooperating with one another.	我是中文句子
The John Deeres and Monsantos have now joined forces.	我是中文句子
But while this possible future bodes well for some of the world’s largest companies, it leaves the environmental and social problems associated with industrialized agriculture unsolved.	我是中文句子
Most farmers, particularly in the global South, will never be able to afford expensive digital-age machinery.	我是中文句子
The maxim “grow or go” will be replaced with “digitize or disappear.”	我是中文句子
The ETC Group, an American non-governmental organization, has already outlined a future scenario in which the major agrotechnology corporations move upstream and absorb the seed and pesticide producers.	我是中文句子
At that point, just a few companies will determine everything that we eat.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the same market-concentration problem applies to other links in the value chain, such as agricultural traders and supermarkets.	我是中文句子
These companies make money when fresh or semi-processed food is replaced by highly processed convenience foods such as frozen pizza, canned soup, and ready-made meals.	我是中文句子
While lucrative, this business model is closely linked to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, corporations are amassing market power at the expense of those at the bottom of the value chain: farmers and workers.	我是中文句子
International Labor Organization standards guarantee all workers the right to organize, and they prohibit forced and child labor and proscribe race and gender discrimination.	我是中文句子
In this hostile climate, minimum-wage, overtime-pay, and workplace-safety standards are openly neglected.	我是中文句子
And women, in particular, are at a disadvantage, because they are paid less than their male counterparts and often must settle for seasonal or temporary jobs.	我是中文句子
Today, half of the world’s 800 million starving people are small farmers and workers connected to the agricultural sector.	我是中文句子
Their lot will hardly improve if the few companies already dominating that sector become even more powerful.	我是中文句子
How to Feed the World	我是中文句子
PRAGUE – Hunger has wracked humanity since time immemorial.	我是中文句子
Yet the struggle against hunger is a battle that humanity could finally win.	我是中文句子
Since 1992, the number of hungry people worldwide has plummeted by more than 200 million, even as the human population grew by nearly two billion.	我是中文句子
But enormous challenges remain.	我是中文句子
Affordable, nutritious food is one of people’s top priorities everywhere, and one in nine people still do not get enough food to be healthy.	我是中文句子
With today’s population of 7.3 billion expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050, food demand will increase accordingly.	我是中文句子
Along with more mouths to feed, stresses on food supplies will include conflicts, economic volatility, extreme weather events, and climate change.	我是中文句子
Between 1930 and 2000, agricultural output in the United States quadrupled, with productivity growth outstripping that of manufacturing.	我是中文句子
The World Bank has found that productivity growth in agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth from other sectors.	我是中文句子
So how do we keep up this progress?	我是中文句子
Investment in research and development is vital.	我是中文句子
Achieving these targets would be worth nearly $3 trillion in social good, implying an enormous return of $34 for every dollar spent.	我是中文句子
Another way to increase agricultural productivity is through labor.	我是中文句子
Investing around $9,000 per worker over two decades could boost agricultural productivity by 10%.	我是中文句子
Unsurprisingly, the Bangladeshi prime minister’s office is striving to lead in global innovation, sustaining an agriculture innovation lab that shares best practices and ideas.	我是中文句子
“We cannot feed our people two times a day – we need to increase our agricultural productivity.”	我是中文句子
Humanity’s fight against hunger can be won.	我是中文句子
Great progress has been made, but the world needs more agricultural R&D and higher productivity.	我是中文句子
We would do well to listen.	我是中文句子
An Arab Marshall Plan	我是中文句子
OXFORD – The wave of revolts that swept across the Arab world two years ago were fueled by demands for freedom, bread, and social justice.	我是中文句子
But, although the revolutions toppled dictators and transformed societies, these core objectives remain as distant as ever.	我是中文句子
In fact, the economic challenges facing the Arab Spring countries have become even more pressing, weighing heavily on these countries’ political prospects.	我是中文句子
Unemployment has nearly doubled in Tunisia and Egypt, and foreign direct investment has dried up across the Arab world.	我是中文句子
Tourism revenues, while resilient, are declining, and fiscal challenges remain considerable.	我是中文句子
But the economic urgency is not reflected in the policy response, which has been painfully slow or non-existent.	我是中文句子
For example, Egypt’s fiscal deficit will exceed 11% of GDP this year.	我是中文句子
But the country’s leaders have been stalling on the terms of a much-needed International Monetary Fund loan.	我是中文句子
Almost all political stakeholders in Egypt, as in the other Arab countries in transition, recognize the need for economic reform.	我是中文句子
But neither citizens nor policymakers appear willing to bear its social and political costs.	我是中文句子
In a charged and uncertain political climate, in which new crises erupt on a daily basis, it is unsurprising that economic reform has been postponed repeatedly.	我是中文句子
Politicians know that macroeconomic stabilization and social cohesion can be irreconcilable in the short run.	我是中文句子
Slashing food and energy subsidies in order to reduce fiscal strain is unlikely to win favor in a country like Egypt, where 40% of per capita income is allocated to food.	我是中文句子
Politics is thus constraining efforts to strengthen public finances.	我是中文句子
At the same time, narrow IMF prescriptions threaten to exacerbate political instability, with citizens no longer afraid to take to the streets to demonstrate their dissatisfaction.	我是中文句子
But such a move is far too risky for an individual politician, or even a single country, at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment.	我是中文句子
It is much easier to reform subsidy programs when the economy is expanding.	我是中文句子
Moreover, building competitive markets is essential to ensuring sustainable GDP growth.	我是中文句子
By agreeing to the pact, Arab countries would commit to reforming their subsidy systems and to reducing restrictions on cross-border economic exchange.	我是中文句子
The regional dimension of prosperity has long been ignored in the Arab world.	我是中文句子
But weak regional linkages limit small firms’ growth potential, forcing them to depend on state patronage.	我是中文句子
And, while Tunisia’s situation seems to be the most promising, a crippling investment shortfall is threatening to derail reform efforts there.	我是中文句子
With Europe mired in crisis, capital flows from Tunisia’s resource-rich Arab neighbors are its best hope.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, Arab countries must ratchet up development spending.	我是中文句子
New investment vehicles, such as sovereign wealth funds and Islamic finance, can contribute financing to credit-starved firms.	我是中文句子
At the same time, Arab countries must streamline current aid efforts.	我是中文句子
Over the last two years, Saudi Arabia has provided more than $3 billion to Yemen.	我是中文句子
Qatar has provided  $5 billion to Egypt since 2011, with a promise of $3 billion more.	我是中文句子
And the United Arab Emirates recently pledged $2.5 billion to Bahrain.	我是中文句子
But unconditional aid only delays reforms, because it weakens budget constraints, which reduces pressure on policymakers and creates moral hazard.	我是中文句子
The Arab Spring has exposed fault lines that run not just through individual countries, but also through the entire region.	我是中文句子
This calls for redefining relationships not only between citizens and states, but also among Arab countries.	我是中文句子
Above all, it is no longer prudent to divide Arab countries between donors and recipients, or between resource-rich and resource-poor countries.	我是中文句子
It is in the interest of the entire region – including those countries that do not seem to face an imminent threat of revolt – to contribute to their neighbors’ economic revival and facilitate their political transitions.	我是中文句子
The Ahistorical Federal Reserve	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – Economic developments over the past 20 years have taught – or ought to have taught – the US Federal Reserve four lessons.	我是中文句子
Yet the Fed’s current policy posture raises the question of whether it has internalized any of them.	我是中文句子
The Fed protests that to change its inflation target even once would erode the credibility of its commitment to ensuring price stability.	我是中文句子
But the Fed can pay now or it can pay later.	我是中文句子
After all, what good is credibility today when it means sticking tenaciously to a policy that deprives you of the ability to do your job properly tomorrow?	我是中文句子
Then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan recognized this in the 1990s.	我是中文句子
He rightly judged that pushing for faster growth and lower unemployment was not taking excessive risks, but rather harvesting low-hanging fruit.	我是中文句子
The current Fed appears to have a different view.	我是中文句子
The third lesson is that yield-curve inversion in the bond market is not just a sign that the market thinks that monetary policy is too tight; it is a sign that monetary policy really is too tight.	我是中文句子
But 2006, just before the financial crisis hit, was supposed to be different, too.	我是中文句子
(And there were plenty of times before then that were supposed to be different, too.)	我是中文句子
History suggests that this time is highly unlikely to be different – and that it will not end well if the Fed continues to believe and behave otherwise.	我是中文句子
The fourth lesson similarly reflects developments extending back further than 20 years.	我是中文句子
Back in the 1980s, it was not unreasonable to argue that the next large shock to the US macroeconomy was likely to be inflationary.	我是中文句子
It is much more difficult to reasonably argue that today.	我是中文句子
But, at least as I see it, right now the Fed’s process of getting from a realistic view of the economy to an appropriate monetary policy does not seem to be functioning well at all.	我是中文句子
Perhaps it is time for the Fed to place its internal discussions in a more explicit framework.	我是中文句子
The problem for optimal control methods is that the real world is not some closed system where economic relationships never change, or where they change in fully predictable ways.	我是中文句子
A History Lesson for Koizumi	我是中文句子
Once again, protests against Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s annual visit to the Yasukuni shrine are breaking out in China as well as South Korea.	我是中文句子
Koizumi’s insistence on paying homage to the war dead interred at Yasukuni, where convicted war criminals from World War II are among the buried, has been damaging relations with Japan’s neighbors for years.	我是中文句子
Even some in Japan are becoming critical of Koizumi.	我是中文句子
More people are not supporting Koizumi’s annual pilgrimage to Yasukuni, with seven former prime ministers jointly demanding that he refrain from the visits.	我是中文句子
Yet Koizumi remains defiant.	我是中文句子
Moreover, Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzu Abe, the front-runner to succeed him, has openly declared that he will continue to visit the shrine as prime minister.	我是中文句子
Foreign Minister Taro Aso, another possible successor to Koizumi, has called for the Japanese Emperor to pray at Yasukuni.	我是中文句子
So pessimism appears to be settling in, and the deadlock over Yasukuni appears to be deepening.	我是中文句子
But the past can bring us more than just troubles of this kind.	我是中文句子
Even on the issue of Yasukuni, there are positive lessons to be learned.	我是中文句子
Consider Yasuhiro Nakasone, Koizumi’s predecessor in the 1980’s.	我是中文句子
Both are master politicians who remained popular and served long terms in office.	我是中文句子
Both are conservative and nationalistic, advocating the revision of the constitution and an assertive political and military role for Japan abroad.	我是中文句子
But a crucial difference between Nakasone and Koizumi is often overlooked: their handling of the Yasukuni controversy and relations with China.	我是中文句子
The decision triggered a severe response from China, where students held demonstrations against his visit.	我是中文句子
Bilateral relations were frozen.	我是中文句子
But, instead of capitalizing on domestic resentment over China’s criticisms, Nakasone decided not to visit Yasukuni again.	我是中文句子
He chose to mend relations with China by focusing on the positive aspects of bilateral ties.	我是中文句子
This genuine embrace of reconciliation provided much-needed support to Chinese leaders, who were eager to control anti-Japanese sentiments.	我是中文句子
Nakasone emerged from the crisis and was recognized as a capable statesman in managing Japan’s diplomacy with China.	我是中文句子
There was no accusation that Nakasone was “selling out” to Beijing.	我是中文句子
Nor were his conservative, nationalist, and pro-American credentials damaged.	我是中文句子
This episode suggests that Koizumi’s hardline position isn’t the only option.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, Koizumi and his allies are not prepared to move forward on the Yasukuni issue.	我是中文句子
As Foreign Minister Aso recently put it: “The more China voices [opposition], the more one feels like going there.	我是中文句子
It’s just like when you’re told ‘Don't smoke cigarettes,’ it actually makes you want to smoke.”	我是中文句子
Israel versus America versus Iran	我是中文句子
TEL AVIV – Israel’s concern about the specter of a nuclear Iran has now degenerated into a crisis of confidence concerning the United States.	我是中文句子
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has embarked on a campaign to force President Barack Obama to set a red line that Iran must not cross, lest it risk unleashing an American military response.	我是中文句子
Implicit threats of a unilateral Israeli attack, together with conspicuous meddling in the US presidential election campaign, have compounded Netanyahu’s effort to twist Obama’s arm.	我是中文句子
But, equally important, the dispute underscores their different objectives.	我是中文句子
For Israel, war with Iran is not about neutralizing an existential threat; it is about reasserting its regional status.	我是中文句子
The fallout from a war in Iran would pin down the US in the Middle East for years to come, undermining its new strategic priorities.	我是中文句子
To guarantee that Iran never acquires a nuclear bomb, the US would need to maintain military pressure on Iran for several years.	我是中文句子
The pre-Arab Spring paradigm that framed the Middle East as being divided between “moderates” and “extremists” has become obsolete.	我是中文句子
The Islamist governments that have emerged from the downfall of America’s puppet regimes are no friends of an Iranian nuclear empire.	我是中文句子
But, in their struggle to survive, they must channel popular anti-Americanism.	我是中文句子
For Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, that imperative meant placating the angry mob that recently attacked the US embassy rather than merely condemning the violence.	我是中文句子
It would be impossible to rule out a regional war.	我是中文句子
The main problem facing a military operation in Iran is the need to ensure its legitimacy.	我是中文句子
China and Russia would never allow the US to secure a United Nations mandate for an attack.	我是中文句子
The dire legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan weighs heavily on the Western democracies.	我是中文句子
The saddest part of the story is Israel’s utter indifference to the need to build international legitimacy for its drive to stop Iran’s nuclear program.	我是中文句子
Netanyahu thinks in bold military terms, not in terms of geopolitical strategy.	我是中文句子
His careless Palestine policy has left Israel with few friends in the international community, let alone in the Arab Middle East.	我是中文句子
Indeed, many regard Netanyahu’s Iran obsession as nothing more than a successful ploy to divert attention from the Palestinian issue.	我是中文句子
And only that outcome can secure the international goodwill that both Israel and the US will need for a showdown with Iran.	我是中文句子
A Human Rights Crime In Gaza	我是中文句子
On a recent trip through the Middle East, I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis.	我是中文句子
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism, since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants.	我是中文句子
Subsequently, I met with leaders of Hamas, both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus, Syria.	我是中文句子
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and also rejected.	我是中文句子
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land.	我是中文句子
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions.	我是中文句子
A Hundred Years of Superconductivity	我是中文句子
This spring marked the 100th anniversary of the discovery of superconductivity – the ability of materials to carry electrical current with no loss.	我是中文句子
Currents set up in superconducting wires can exist for years without any measurable decay.	我是中文句子
Because of this property, superconductors have unique features that can be exploited in many ways.	我是中文句子
They can carry enormous amounts of current, making them ideal for urban power grids. And, when wound into coils, they can produce extremely strong magnetic fields.	我是中文句子
Such superconducting magnets have been applied in a variety of technologies.	我是中文句子
The best-known examples are the magnets that drive the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines found in most hospitals.	我是中文句子
Such temperatures can be achieved only through liquid-helium cooling.	我是中文句子
Shortly thereafter, researchers in the United States found a related material that superconducts above the temperature at which air liquefies.	我是中文句子
Alas, the revolution soon bogged down.	我是中文句子
Cuprates are notoriously difficult materials to work with, because they are very brittle.	我是中文句子
Although none of them superconduct at temperatures as high as liquid air, they may ultimately be better materials with which to work.	我是中文句子
Given the vast number of combinations of elements that can form compounds, there is a good chance that better superconductors await our discovery.	我是中文句子
In the coming years, superconductors are expected to play a growing role in technology.	我是中文句子
Already, “second generation” cuprate wires are being used to make high-capacity cables for electric-power transmission, and lighter-weight generators for wind turbines.	我是中文句子
Stronger superconducting magnets are leading to the development of MRIs with more sophisticated diagnostic capabilities.	我是中文句子
Superconductors are being used for levitated trains in high-speed rail transport, and as microwave filters for improved signal bandwidth in cellular base stations.	我是中文句子
The discovery of a new superconductor with enhanced properties could lead to even greater technological innovation.	我是中文句子
This brings us to the intellectual challenge of superconductors.	我是中文句子
It took 46 years from the discovery of superconductivity to the 1957 Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of how the phenomenon occurs.	我是中文句子
Discovering the solution required the development of advanced theoretical techniques.	我是中文句子
What had been difficult to figure out was how to get electrons to superconduct.	我是中文句子
The basic discovery of BCS was that if the electrons pair up, those couples could indeed superconduct.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, the mechanism for such coupling was known.	我是中文句子
The suspicion, though, is that this is not the case in the new superconductors.	我是中文句子
How can one pair electrons without ions holding them together, thereby enabling higher-temperature superconductors?	我是中文句子
Whatever the theory turns out to be, it is certain to revolutionize physics.	我是中文句子
Lies, Damned Lies, and AI	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – Algorithms are as biased as the data they feed on.	我是中文句子
And all data are biased.	我是中文句子
Even “official” statistics cannot be assumed to stand for objective, eternal “facts.”	我是中文句子
The figures that governments publish represent society as it is now, through the lens of what those assembling the data consider to be relevant and important.	我是中文句子
The categories and classifications used to make sense of the data are not neutral.	我是中文句子
Just as we measure what we see, so we tend to see only what we measure.	我是中文句子
As algorithmic decision-making spreads to a wider range of policymaking areas, it is shedding a harsh light on the social biases that once lurked in the shadows of the data we collect.	我是中文句子
By taking existing structures and processes to their logical extremes, artificial intelligence (AI) is forcing us to confront the kind of society we have created.	我是中文句子
An AI, after all, is as infallible a version of homo economicus as one can imagine.	我是中文句子
It is a rationally calculating, logically consistent, ends-oriented agent capable of achieving its desired outcomes with finite computational resources.	我是中文句子
When it comes to “maximizing utility,” they are far more effective than any human.	我是中文句子
“Utility” is to economics what “phlogiston” once was to chemistry.	我是中文句子
Yet, try as they might, scientists never could confirm the hypothesis.	我是中文句子
They could not track down phlogiston for the same reason that economists today cannot offer a measure of actual utility.	我是中文句子
Despite not existing, utility is a powerful construct.	我是中文句子
It seems only natural to suppose that everyone is trying to do as well as they can for themselves.	我是中文句子
Moreover, economists’ notion of utility is born of classical utilitarianism, which aims to secure the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people.	我是中文句子
But this assumption can produce troubling outcomes.	我是中文句子
For example, consider how algorithms are being used to decide whether prisoners are deserving of parole.	我是中文句子
In the United States, then, AIs could be used to reduce a prison population that is disproportionately black.	我是中文句子
But what happens when AIs take over the parole process and African-Americans are still being jailed at a higher rate than whites?	我是中文句子
Highly efficient algorithmic decision-making has brought such questions to the fore, forcing us to decide precisely which outcomes should be maximized.	我是中文句子
Do we want merely to reduce the overall prison population, or should we also be concerned about fairness?	我是中文句子
Whereas politics allows for fudges and compromises to disguise such tradeoffs, computer code requires clarity.	我是中文句子
That demand for clarity is making it harder to ignore the structural sources of societal inequities.	我是中文句子
Thanks to groups such as the AI Ethics Initiative and the Partnership on AI, a broader debate about the ethics of AI has begun to emerge.	我是中文句子
But AI algorithms are of course just doing what they are coded to do.	我是中文句子
The real issue extends beyond the use of algorithmic decision-making in corporate and political governance, and strikes at the ethical foundations of our societies.	我是中文句子
Algorithms are posing fundamental questions about how we have organized social, political, and economic relations to date.	我是中文句子
We now must decide if we really want to encode current social arrangements into the decision-making structures of the future.	我是中文句子
Given the political fracturing currently occurring around the world, this seems like a good moment to write a new script.	我是中文句子
A Better Global Framework to End AIDS	我是中文句子
STOCKHOLM, GENEVA – This week, we celebrate the tremendous progress that has been made in the struggle against HIV and AIDS.	我是中文句子
In many countries with strong health systems, HIV is no longer a death sentence, but a chronic condition.	我是中文句子
And Africa has reached a critical milestone: each year, there are now more Africans starting HIV treatment than being infected.	我是中文句子
Still, even as we celebrate, we must also mourn the 1.1 million people who lost their lives to the disease this year.	我是中文句子
HIV still infects 6,000 people every day, and AIDS remains a leading cause of death among children, adolescents, and women in Africa.	我是中文句子
The movement against AIDS has inspired all of us to help the people who continue to be left behind, and to commit to ending AIDS once and for all.	我是中文句子
But funding parts of the global health system is not enough.	我是中文句子
Providing the necessary support will require donors to coordinate with one another, so that all parts of the existing architecture for managing global health issues are adequately funded.	我是中文句子
This will then ensure that all countries – and, more importantly, all people – receive the support they need.	我是中文句子
One of UNAIDS’ tasks is to encourage national governments to keep AIDS high on their public-health agendas, and to invest in joint efforts to end the disease.	我是中文句子
UNAIDS maintains a close partnership with the Global Fund.	我是中文句子
As such, UNAIDS works to expand the political space for – and investment in – civil society.	我是中文句子
We will safeguard and empower women and girls, and make sure that vulnerable populations’ voices are heard.	我是中文句子
But, at the same time, the international community must strengthen the existing framework for managing global-health issues.	我是中文句子
AIDS, NCDs, and the ABCs of Organizing	我是中文句子
There is incontrovertible evidence that tobacco use, inactivity, unhealthy diets, and excessive alcohol consumption increase the odds of dying prematurely from an NCD.	我是中文句子
And yet, despite widespread knowledge of the risks, global obesity goes largely unchecked, while tobacco and alcohol use continue to rise.	我是中文句子
It is against this backdrop that networks of NCD alliances met December 9-11 at the second Global NCD Alliance Forum, in the United Arab Emirates.	我是中文句子
As they search for solutions to bring NCDs under control, they should look for inspiration to the movement to fight AIDS.	我是中文句子
People living with and affected by HIV continue to drive response efforts, and their unique form of mobilization has been instrumental to progress.	我是中文句子
While the battle is not over, AIDS activists know that it can be won.	我是中文句子
Similarly, a mobilized NCD movement can turn the tide against that epidemic.	我是中文句子
He added: “But who has the courage to deliver it?”	我是中文句子
We believe there are lessons to be learned from AIDS activists.	我是中文句子
As global attention focuses on NCD prevention, those seeking to control preventable illnesses should look to the “ABCs” of AIDS organizing for guidance.	我是中文句子
The first letter that the NCD community should consider is “A,” for activism.	我是中文句子
Anyone over 40 will recall images of AIDS activists performing “die-ins” at scientific meetings around the world.	我是中文句子
In the United States, AIDS activists took to the streets, even shutting down the Food and Drug Administration’s headquarters for a day in October 1988.	我是中文句子
Globally, activists lobbied governments and pharmaceutical companies to make medicines more affordable.	我是中文句子
This activism continues, and should serve as a model for action on NCDs.	我是中文句子
Next, the NCD community must adopt a bolder approach to budgets – the “B” of the AIDS movement’s strategy.	我是中文句子
Civic organizing and grassroots activism may fuel early energies, but organizing and sustaining a broad-based coalition takes money.	我是中文句子
The AIDS movement was clear about this from the beginning, and lobbied for resources to support its advocacy and accountability effectively.	我是中文句子
Activists established links between people living with HIV and those with other concerns, such as women’s rights, intellectual property, nutrition, and housing.	我是中文句子
The AIDS movement also understood that a holistic response to the epidemic was essential.	我是中文句子
Thus, “D,” the underlying determinants of health, was to draw attention to the interconnectivity of the drivers of challenge.	我是中文句子
NCDs are no less isolated in their causality, and similarly require a multi-sector approach to prevention.	我是中文句子
Engagement – “E” – was what helped the AIDS movement become so influential.	我是中文句子
For example, UNAIDS remains the only United Nations agency with seats on its board for representatives from civil society.	我是中文句子
This norm is so powerfully embedded in the AIDS movement that it would be almost unthinkable for an AIDS meeting to take place without representation from the community.	我是中文句子
In particular, access to AIDS treatment was framed as a matter of economic justice.	我是中文句子
Framing the narrative this way led to a dramatic reduction in the price of medicines, so much so that more than half of people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries are in treatment.	我是中文句子
An equally important framing issue for AIDS, which is highly relevant to the NCDs movement, is that of responsibility.	我是中文句子
The AIDS community worked hard to shift the focus from blaming individuals’ lifestyle choices to putting the onus on the state for providing health care and removing legal discrimination.	我是中文句子
In the AIDS debate, gender – our movement’s “G” – was a significant focal point.	我是中文句子
HIV was initially seen as a “gay disease,” and gender identity was embedded in the DNA of the AIDS movement early on.	我是中文句子
Gender dimensions of NCDs are no less important; one only has to consider how alcohol and tobacco are marketed to understand that.	我是中文句子
Gender, therefore, must become a focus of NCDs prevention efforts.	我是中文句子
Finally, “H” – human rights – was the bedrock of the AIDS response.	我是中文句子
Campaigns were launched against discrimination in workplaces, schools, and health centers.	我是中文句子
Strategic litigation helped ensure equality under the law.	我是中文句子
The AIDS movement refused to hold major conferences in countries with punitive laws against people living with HIV.	我是中文句子
The NCD movement could take a similar tack by, for example, refusing to meet in countries that fail to restrict advertising of junk food to children.	我是中文句子
Poverty, exclusion, and social and economic marginalization put people at higher risk for HIV.	我是中文句子
It is no different for NCDs.	我是中文句子
The early mainstream reaction to the AIDS epidemic was to ask, “Why don’t those people make better choices?”	我是中文句子
The AIDS movement made clear that that was the wrong question.	我是中文句子
Today, with 70% of the planet at risk of premature death from preventable illnesses, “those people” are many of us.	我是中文句子
The NCD and AIDS communities can learn from one another.	我是中文句子
We are a stronger movement when we join forces.	我是中文句子
The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of UNAIDS.	我是中文句子
Aid Works	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The critics of foreign aid are wrong.	我是中文句子
A growing flood of data shows that death rates in many poor countries are falling sharply, and that aid-supported programs for health-care delivery have played a key role.	我是中文句子
Aid works; it saves lives.	我是中文句子
Let’s turn back the clock a dozen years.	我是中文句子
In 2000, Africa was struggling with three major epidemics.	我是中文句子
AIDS was killing more than two million people each year, and spreading rapidly.	我是中文句子
Malaria was surging, owing to the parasite’s growing resistance to the standard medicine at the time.	我是中文句子
Tuberculosis was also soaring, partly as a result of the AIDS epidemic and partly because of the emergence of drug-resistant TB.	我是中文句子
In addition, hundreds of thousands of women were dying in childbirth each year, because they had no access to safe deliveries in a clinic or hospital, or to emergency help when needed.	我是中文句子
These interconnected crises prompted action.	我是中文句子
The United Nations’ member states adopted the Millennium Development Goals in September 2000.	我是中文句子
Three of the eight MDGs – reductions in children’s deaths, maternal deaths, and epidemic diseases – focus directly on health.	我是中文句子
Likewise, the World Health Organization issued a major call to scale up development assistance for health.	我是中文句子
And African leaders, led by Nigeria’s president at the time, Olusegun Obasanjo, took on the challenge of battling the continent’s epidemics.	我是中文句子
The Global Fund began operations in 2002, financing prevention, treatment, and care programs for the three diseases.	我是中文句子
High-income countries also finally agreed to reduce the debt owed by heavily indebted poor countries, allowing them to spend more on health care and less on crippling payments to creditors.	我是中文句子
The United States also took action, adopting two major programs, one to fight AIDS and the other to fight malaria.	我是中文句子
The UN General Assembly backed many of the project’s recommendations, which were then implemented in numerous low-income countries.	我是中文句子
Donor aid did start to rise sharply as a result of all of these efforts.	我是中文句子
In 1995, total aid for health care was around $7.9 billion.	我是中文句子
This inadequate level then crept up slowly, to $10.5 billion by 2000.	我是中文句子
Many innovative public-health techniques were developed and adopted.	我是中文句子
The public-health successes can now be seen on many fronts.	我是中文句子
Around 12 million children under five years old died in 1990.	我是中文句子
By 2010, this number had declined to around 7.6 million – still far too high, but definitely an historic improvement.	我是中文句子
The MDGs for health could be achieved even in many of the world’s poorest countries.	我是中文句子
Their attacks have been relentless (I’ve faced my share).	我是中文句子
The opponents of aid are not merely wrong.	我是中文句子
A decade of significant progress in health outcomes has proved the skeptics wrong.	我是中文句子
Aid for health care works – and works magnificently – to save and improve lives.	我是中文句子
Let us continue to support these life-saving programs, which uphold the dignity and well-being of all people on the planet.	我是中文句子
The AIIB and Global Governance	我是中文句子
Regardless of what naysayers believe, this remarkable turn of events can only benefit global economic governance.	我是中文句子
Who is right will depend largely on the decisions that the AIIB’s top shareholders make regarding its operating structure.	我是中文句子
So far, the AIIB has not sought to amend the principle that the largest contributor to a multilateral organization gets the largest say in running it.	我是中文句子
Just as the US dominates the World Bank and Europe leads the International Monetary Fund, China will head the AIIB.	我是中文句子
This implies a larger global leadership role for China – which the world, including its traditional powers, should welcome.	我是中文句子
After all, global leadership is not just a matter of might; it also reflects the provision of global public goods.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, China is willing and able to fill the gap.	我是中文句子
The United Kingdom and France – which are one-third the size of China – each have a 4.3% share.	我是中文句子
With the incumbents unwilling to bring China’s voting share in line with its economic might, China had little choice but to launch its own institution.	我是中文句子
But the AIIB has its own objectives, which do not align precisely with those of, say, the World Bank.	我是中文句子
While the US “pivots” to the east, China is pirouetting west, applying the lessons of its development to its trading partners across Eurasia and beyond.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the most important of these lessons is that connectivity is vital to economic growth.	我是中文句子
The $100 billion AIIB will play a central role in this effort.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, it will compete with them, owing to its distinctive – and probably more efficient – approach to lending.	我是中文句子
The acid test of the AIIB’s effectiveness will be its governance model.	我是中文句子
The World Bank has wasted far too much time re-organizing itself under various presidents, without recognizing the fundamental problem with its own governance structure.	我是中文句子
If Western leaders really do believe in innovation, competition, and meritocracy, they should welcome the AIIB.	我是中文句子
AIPAC in Decline	我是中文句子
MADRID – The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s lobbying power in the United States is undeniable.	我是中文句子
But AIPAC’s supposed ability to control US policy decisions is a Potemkin village myth, cultivated by friends and rivals alike.	我是中文句子
In fact, thanks to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, AIPAC’s influence is under threat – though Netanyahu himself will be just fine.	我是中文句子
Claims about AIPAC’s clout have long shaped analysis of US foreign policy.	我是中文句子
The truth about AIPAC – that it is influential, but far from invulnerable – has recently been revealed, both to the public and to the group itself.	我是中文句子
In fact, AIPAC has never overcome resolute opposition from an American president, particularly in a matter of US national security.	我是中文句子
It failed to stop Jimmy Carter from selling F-15 Eagle fighters to Saudi Arabia in 1978, or to prevent Ronald Reagan from supplying AWACS reconnaissance planes to the Saudis three years later.	我是中文句子
Indeed, Obama even used a tactic similar to that of George H.W. Bush to win the day.	我是中文句子
He also put AIPAC in the same category as the Republicans who “were responsible” for leading the US into the Iraq war.	我是中文句子
Of course, the nuclear deal involved more than just the US and Iran.	我是中文句子
AIPAC was opposing an international agreement that six major world powers – China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US – had already signed and that the United Nations had approved.	我是中文句子
Yet that is the objective that Netanyahu set for AIPAC.	我是中文句子
The row over the Iran deal is bound to be a watershed moment for American Jews, among whom sharp divisions have formed.	我是中文句子
AIPAC represents a striking anomaly in the life of American Jews.	我是中文句子
The truth is that American Jews largely opposed the Iraq war.	我是中文句子
They overwhelmingly vote for the Democratic Party.	我是中文句子
The majority of American Jews even support the creation of a Palestinian state.	我是中文句子
And, although they are far from united on the Iran deal, the agreement’s supporters outnumber its opponents.	我是中文句子
Much of the blame for the damage that has been done – to AIPAC, American Jewish communities, and even the US political process – falls on Netanyahu.	我是中文句子
But he is unlikely to face retribution for any of it.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, the Obama administration has already begun the discussions it promised on upgrading Israel’s strategic capabilities.	我是中文句子
After all, Obama’s victory on the nuclear deal may have been inevitable, but it was far from easy.	我是中文句子
As a result, America’s cold war with Iran is likely to persist.	我是中文句子
The Dawn of Climate-Friendly Air Travel	我是中文句子
Fortunately, now is the perfect time to decouple aviation emissions from air-travel growth.	我是中文句子
When implemented, it will be the first carbon-emissions cap on a global industry that does not noticeably increase costs for consumers.	我是中文句子
And airlines will purchase emissions reductions from other economic sectors, thus funneling billions of dollars into low-carbon development around the world.	我是中文句子
If the countries can leapfrog over old technologies, they can become new leaders in carbon-smart flying.	我是中文句子
They should seize the opportunity before them and join the ICAO framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward.	我是中文句子
At the Paris climate talks last year, we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change.	我是中文句子
The ICAO agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change.	我是中文句子
Together, the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth.	我是中文句子
By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet.	我是中文句子
Europe’s Airpocalypse	我是中文句子
SINGAPORE – European policymakers like to lecture the rest of the world on air pollution.	我是中文句子
Asia, and China in particular, is a favorite target for criticism.	我是中文句子
When it comes to air pollution, however, Europe might consider doing less talking and more listening.	我是中文句子
Air pollution is a growing concern across Europe.	我是中文句子
London and Paris suffer from particularly severe air-quality problems.	我是中文句子
Nitrogen dioxide levels in some parts of London regularly reach 2-3 times the recommended limit.	我是中文句子
In the United Kingdom, air pollution kills some 29,000 people a year, putting it second only to smoking as a cause of premature death.	我是中文句子
Paris may be even worse off; in March, after air-pollution levels surpassed Shanghai’s, the city imposed a partial driving ban and introduced free public transportation.	我是中文句子
Sadly, Europe’s policymakers do not seem up to the challenge.	我是中文句子
George Osborne, the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer, has argued against British leadership in the fight against climate change.	我是中文句子
“We are not going to save the planet by shutting down our steel mills, aluminum smelters, and paper manufacturers,” he declared in 2011.	我是中文句子
Osborne is not alone.	我是中文句子
The EU’s proposed standards regulating toxic emissions from coal plants are even less strict than China’s, Greenpeace reports.	我是中文句子
Yet various European politicians have called for watering them down even further, with Hungary suggesting that they be scrapped altogether.	我是中文句子
To be sure, air pollution levels in Asia are truly worrisome.	我是中文句子
The continent is home to nine of the world’s ten most polluted countries, according to Yale University’s 2014 Air Quality Ranking.	我是中文句子
New Delhi is ranked as the most polluted city on earth, with air pollution exceeding safe levels by a factor of 60.	我是中文句子
Owing to Beijing’s unhealthy air, foreign companies pay a “hardship bonus” of up to 30% to employees working there.	我是中文句子
But at least policymakers in Asia have recognized the problem and are taking steps to address it.	我是中文句子
China, for example, has declared a “war on pollution.”	我是中文句子
By 2017, Beijing – once dubbed “Greyjing” by the international media – will spend some CN¥760 billion ($121 billion) to combat air pollution.	我是中文句子
At the heart of China’s measures are improved public transportation, green trade, and a revision of the energy mix.	我是中文句子
The government has decided to install bus stops every 500 meters in city centers, reduce tariffs to 5% or less for a list of 54 environmental goods, and decommission many outdated and inefficient coal plants.	我是中文句子
The share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption is expected to increase to 20% by 2030.	我是中文句子
These targets are likely to be rigorously implemented, given strong political support from the very top.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, in India, the state governments in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu are about to launch the world’s first cap-and-trade schemes for particulates.	我是中文句子
India’s Supreme Court even suggested an extra charge on privately owned diesel vehicles in New Delhi.	我是中文句子
Other parts of Asia are also taking steps to improve air quality.	我是中文句子
Vietnam aims to construct eight urban rail lines in the coming years.	我是中文句子
Bangkok, which has been tackling air pollution since the 1990s, has planted 400,000 trees.	我是中文句子
And Japan is offering subsidies for hydrogen cars and creating new pedestrian-only areas.	我是中文句子
Europe, as one of the world’s wealthiest regions, ought to be at the forefront of the effort to promote environmental sustainability.	我是中文句子
When it comes to air pollution, however, Europe’s policymakers should stop preaching to others and focus on fixing their own problems.	我是中文句子
A Japanese Metamorphosis?	我是中文句子
For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system.	我是中文句子
Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government.	我是中文句子
The Japanese public, even now, remains uncertain about the DPJ’s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution, which lack solid funding.	我是中文句子
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy	我是中文句子
Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP.	我是中文句子
For the last four years, the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling.	我是中文句子
The LDP’s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party’s power nucleus had melted down.	我是中文句子
Indeed, immediately after the election, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due.	我是中文句子
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP.	我是中文句子
But time is short, and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen.	我是中文句子
The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unprepared to tame the mandarins, and so may be forced to rely on them.	我是中文句子
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan’s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period.	我是中文句子
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.	我是中文句子
As a result, the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged, and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well.	我是中文句子
They will most likely succeed.	我是中文句子
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.	我是中文句子
Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan’s government polity.	我是中文句子
The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins, partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers.	我是中文句子
Moreover, perhaps in anticipation of a change in power, the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries’ top administrative positions.	我是中文句子
And what of the LDP?	我是中文句子
Having fallen from power, it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds.	我是中文句子
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible.	我是中文句子
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.	我是中文句子
A major power shift in favor of “society” has taken place.	我是中文句子
A Jobless Recovery?	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – Who will suffer the longest and the most from the implosion in 2008-2009 of Wall Street and the ensuing world recession?	我是中文句子
Not the bankers and financiers who created the disaster.	我是中文句子
Some financiers, like Bernard Madoff, will go to prison for fraud.	我是中文句子
The big losers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism.	我是中文句子
Advanced Europe, Canada, and Japan also suffered major job losses that will last for a long time.	我是中文句子
Spain, which allows for widespread temporary contracts, has had the biggest increase in unemployment, because Spanish workers can be fired as quickly as those in the US.	我是中文句子
This can work in the short term, but it cannot be sustained over time.	我是中文句子
From the 1980’s through the mid-2000’s, employment has increasingly lagged GDP in economic recoveries.	我是中文句子
Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate was 6.2% – more than triple the rate in 1990.	我是中文句子
Employment recovered, but primarily in “non-regular” jobs with limited benefits, low wages, and little job security.	我是中文句子
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to second highest (behind the US) among advanced OECD countries.	我是中文句子
Weakness in the job market takes a huge toll on economic and personal well-being.	我是中文句子
Young people seeking their first jobs and experienced workers who lose jobs in a weak job market suffer economic losses that will last their entire lives.	我是中文句子
Studies of happiness show that unemployment reduces happiness by as much as the loss of a family member.	我是中文句子
It is difficult to see the US re-attaining full employment anytime soon.	我是中文句子
From 1993 to 1998, the US created millions of jobs, which raised the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points.	我是中文句子
If employment began rising at this rate in 2010, it would take until 2015 before it reached its pre-recession level.	我是中文句子
And slow recovery in the US will drag down recovery in other advanced countries, reducing their employment as well.	我是中文句子
A long, painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce.	我是中文句子
Many OECD countries initiated various kinds of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along US lines.	我是中文句子
The view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer tenable.	我是中文句子
So the lesson from the recession is clear.	我是中文句子
The weak reed in capitalism is not the labor market, but the financial market.	我是中文句子
Moreover, globalization means that the US capital market’s failure spreads misery around the world.	我是中文句子
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector.	我是中文句子
Since other countries’ economies and jobs are also at stake, they owe it to their citizens to press the US to deliver meaningful financial reforms.	我是中文句子
France’s Midsummer Night’s Dream	我是中文句子
PARIS – Bastille Day, the French national holiday, was glorious this year.	我是中文句子
The Eiffel Tower imbued the evening with its magic.	我是中文句子
Paris, in case anyone had any lingering doubts, remains the capital of the world – or so it seemed for a night.	我是中文句子
The melancholia that began to seize France many years ago was all but forgotten.	我是中文句子
The celebration of the glory of the past, mixed with popular English songs of the present, seemed to indicate renewed national confidence.	我是中文句子
What was the meaning of this moment of grace?	我是中文句子
Even if the positive emotions remain only fleeting (as seems most likely), they were real and palpable.	我是中文句子
The French seemed to be in the mood to celebrate.	我是中文句子
Of course, it could simply have been the weather; a gorgeous summer has finally settled in after a miserable spring.	我是中文句子
But it might also have been one of those natural turning points, a collective and spontaneous decision to say: “Enough of depression, let’s move on.”	我是中文句子
We French may not be what we used to be, the celebrants seemed to be saying, but we are still much more than people think we are.	我是中文句子
One can draw two lessons from this collective form of escapism.	我是中文句子
The first is that, beyond the many layers of depression and distrust in France, there is potential for a new and collective departure.	我是中文句子
This would require, of course, less cynical political elites who can transcend their petty ambitions and divisions for the sake of the country.	我是中文句子
The second lesson, even more obvious, is that reality cannot be changed with a simple public spectacle.	我是中文句子
France is not Imperial Rome, where panem et circenses made a fundamental difference.	我是中文句子
It is a weakened democracy mired in an economic and social crisis so deep that it verges on becoming an identity crisis.	我是中文句子
He, too, was in a reassuring mood.	我是中文句子
His tone and message had changed.	我是中文句子
Of course, given his personality and low public-approval ratings, his address was the least convincing event of the day.	我是中文句子
Who could have said with certainty that the economic upturn announced by Hollande was real rather than aspirational?	我是中文句子
Beyond his message’s wishful thinking, the public’s reaction to the messenger was a mixture of disbelief and indifference.	我是中文句子
Seeing the behavior of friends, all French, listening with me to Hollande, I was reminded of another moment.	我是中文句子
It was December 31, 1989, and I was in the Soviet Union.	我是中文句子
I had found myself in a restaurant in the old city of Suzdal, listening to President Mikhail Gorbachev’s “New Year wishes.”	我是中文句子
But I was alone in paying attention to him.	我是中文句子
The restaurant’s customers, like my French friends now, could not have cared less.	我是中文句子
Their president had become background noise.	我是中文句子
Has Hollande become, in this sense, a French Gorbachev?	我是中文句子
For the left and the Greens, he is close to being a traitor.	我是中文句子
Voters of the center or even the center-right are disappointed, too, by their president’s lack of charisma, if not sheer incompetence.	我是中文句子
After a year of Hollande, France is witnessing a fundamental political revolution.	我是中文句子
During the half-century of the Fifth Republic, a bipartisan system of left and right has traditionally prevailed.	我是中文句子
But now France is becoming a country dominated by a “tripartite system” of more or less equal strength: the left, the right, and the extreme right.	我是中文句子
What Bastille Day revealed, even briefly and superficially, is that the potential to unite France exists.	我是中文句子
But doing so requires more than shallow promises.	我是中文句子
A Kick-Off for Peace?	我是中文句子
Given the two countries’ long-strained relations, this visit would have been remarkable at any time.	我是中文句子
Of course, ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey.	我是中文句子
But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns.	我是中文句子
In the new context set by the war in Georgia, the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone.	我是中文句子
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey’s geography and history.	我是中文句子
For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our path to Europe.	我是中文句子
It is a NATO member, bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs.	我是中文句子
It aspires to join the European Union, and would bring the EU to our three borders, even as we, too, aspire to join one day.	我是中文句子
Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker.	我是中文句子
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.	我是中文句子
This year, as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter, Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel.	我是中文句子
Now, in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis, Turkey’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus.	我是中文句子
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts.	我是中文句子
But, in order to succeed, Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region’s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes.	我是中文句子
In fact, why not take the idea of such a pact one step further?	我是中文句子
We in this region can, and I believe should, call for a non-aligned Caucasus, free of security blocs and adversarial alliances.	我是中文句子
After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their attendant security challenges.	我是中文句子
Our countries and peoples have, throughout history, lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided.	我是中文句子
Today, we share a common vision of European integration, and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved.	我是中文句子
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned.	我是中文句子
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region’s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance.	我是中文句子
But, at the end of the day, we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation.	我是中文句子
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts.	我是中文句子
In fact, real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations.	我是中文句子
One is a lesson from history: Russia’s strategic interests here cannot be ignored.	我是中文句子
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos.	我是中文句子
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever.	我是中文句子
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region.	我是中文句子
Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest.	我是中文句子
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia’s strategic role in the region.	我是中文句子
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia’s real and imagined reliance on Russia.	我是中文句子
Or, for a start, the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational.	我是中文句子
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show.	我是中文句子
President Gul’s visit does mark a watershed – either as a failure to make history, or as the beginning of a new era.	我是中文句子
Truth and Consequences	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The recent re-election of Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, brings hope to a country seeking to end a half-century of conflict.	我是中文句子
But, as with so many peace processes, finding a balance between creating a stable accord and acknowledging the terrible injustices that occurred during the conflict can be difficult to achieve.	我是中文句子
This is frequently the case because the mechanisms established to cope with post-conflict reconciliation, truth, and justice, have proved inadequate.	我是中文句子
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has made important contributions to truth seeking.	我是中文句子
But victims complain that its procedures are slow and abstruse; and many Bosnian Serbs are convinced that the tribunal is selective and politically motivated.	我是中文句子
An agreement between Nepal’s government and Maoist guerrillas to establish a truth commission and investigate the “disappeared” was delayed for seven years.	我是中文句子
Peace negotiators understandably fear that criminal accountability for past crimes will threaten their side’s leaders and supporters.	我是中文句子
Many have wrongly assumed – based on a misinterpretation of the South African experience – that truth commissions provide a “soft” alternative to justice.	我是中文句子
Seeking the truth can be unsettling and painful for anyone, but it comes with serious consequences for those with reason to fear justice.	我是中文句子
But, in order to succeed, these commissions must be effective, independent, and legitimate.	我是中文句子
Half-measures will not do.	我是中文句子
Truth commissions therefore should never be established as “box-ticking” exercises to assuage local public opinion or the international community, as witnessed in Nepal.	我是中文句子
Moreover, a commission should not be led or staffed by individuals of questionable integrity, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the process.	我是中文句子
Above all, truth commissions must be adapted to a country’s particular circumstances.	我是中文句子
A “one-size-fits-all” solution ends up fitting no one.	我是中文句子
It is vital that the details of each case of post-conflict transitional justice are understood and implemented.	我是中文句子
It is all too easy for political leaders to ignore victims or suppress the truth in their quest for a peace deal.	我是中文句子
But recognizing victims’ rights is an indispensable condition for lasting peace.	我是中文句子
Human suffering and victims’ dignity are too powerful to be erased by others’ political pacts.	我是中文句子
Eventually, the past demands its due: justice is not just an ideal; it is an investment in a better future.	我是中文句子
Alan Greenspan on Trial	我是中文句子
The release of Alan Greenspan’s ghostwritten memoirs The Age of Turbulence has elicited charges that he was not such a great central banker after all.	我是中文句子
But what is one to make of the criticisms of Greenspan’s tenure at the Federal Reserve?	我是中文句子
To the first two counts, Greenspan now pleads guilty.	我是中文句子
He says that he did not understand how the growth of non-standard mortgages had lured borrowers and investors into bearing dangerous risks.	我是中文句子
He was, he now says, focusing on how fixed-rate mortgages are relatively bad deals for borrowers in times of low inflation, which was a mistake.	我是中文句子
Greenspan also pleads guilty to a mistake in early 2001.	我是中文句子
He thought that he was giving balanced testimony to Congress on government budget issues.	我是中文句子
He testified that it is important to run surpluses to pay down the debt, but that surpluses must not be so large that the government winds up owning American industry.	我是中文句子
They were right.	我是中文句子
Greenspan also pleads guilty to misunderstanding the character of the Bush administration.	我是中文句子
He thought that his old reality-based friends from the Ford administration were back in power.	我是中文句子
He was wrong.	我是中文句子
But how serious are these policy-political crimes to which Greenspan now pleads guilty?	我是中文句子
In my view, they are misdemeanors.	我是中文句子
Here, Greenspan holds his ground, and pleads not guilty.	我是中文句子
Interest rates high enough to curb stock market speculation would also have curbed construction and other forms of investment, raised unemployment, and sent the economy into recession.	我是中文句子
To cause a significant current evil in order to avoid a possible future danger when our knowledge is limited and our judgments uncertain is, Greenspan believes, unwise.	我是中文句子
In this, he is following a tradition of caution that extends from Edmund Burke to John Maynard Keynes.	我是中文句子
Greenspan mounts a similar defense concerning the housing bubble.	我是中文句子
High construction employment has been good for American workers in the past half-decade – a period that has not produced much good for them.	我是中文句子
Higher interest rates to reduce the housing boom seem, even in retrospect, ill advised if the cost is mass unemployment.	我是中文句子
And Greenspan eschews paternalism: he would not assume the role of a regulator telling people that they cannot buy a house even though a lender is willing to finance it.	我是中文句子
Of course, such a Greenspan would never have been re-appointed.	我是中文句子
A Lasting Poison	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.	我是中文句子
Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past, the young people of Eastern Europe’s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured.	我是中文句子
Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long, you risk becoming a devil yourself.	我是中文句子
A Bolshevik anticommunism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe.	我是中文句子
Opportunism has had its share in this, of course.	我是中文句子
But the case of Kundera appears different – though no less disturbing.	我是中文句子
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison.	我是中文句子
The reclusive Kundera, who immigrated to Paris in 1975, has declared that “it never happened.”	我是中文句子
Until more information is forthcoming, both from Kundera and from the authorities, the case will not be solved “beyond reasonable doubt.”	我是中文句子
But if it happened, the case calls for a deeper reflection.	我是中文句子
Moreover, Kundera’s case is hardly unique.	我是中文句子
Similarly, a few years ago, the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had, in his youth, collaborated with the fascist police.	我是中文句子
I don’t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.	我是中文句子
Why not?	我是中文句子
Shouldn’t that cleaner’s drudgery to support her family, children, and her own survival be taken equally into account?	我是中文句子
If nothing else, in order to forgive, we have to know what we are forgiving.	我是中文句子
In Eastern Europe today, old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson.	我是中文句子
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years, until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality.	我是中文句子
The Albanian Miracle	我是中文句子
TIRANA – Five years ago, Albania faced a truly ominous situation.	我是中文句子
With Greece and Italy reeling from the euro crisis, remittances and capital inflows were falling and the economy suffered a severe slowdown.	我是中文句子
In addition, the power distribution company was in both an operational and a financial crisis, unable to pay for the electricity that it was supposed to buy from power generation companies.	我是中文句子
The arrears of both the government and the power company were fueling an increase in non-performing loans in the banking system.	我是中文句子
All the ingredients of a catastrophic outcome were there.	我是中文句子
It now has the lowest sovereign spread for any country in its rating class, indicating that markets think the rating agencies have been asleep at the wheel.	我是中文句子
If it can maintain its current growth rate, it will reach Germany’s current income in 32 years.	我是中文句子
What was the secret of Albania’s turnaround?	我是中文句子
His government then negotiated a program that allowed Albania to gain financial support while it was putting its fiscal house in order.	我是中文句子
The three-year program ended successfully almost two years ago, and the debt-to-GDP ratio remains on a downward trend.	我是中文句子
This year, it is declining by 2.5% of GDP, while the country is significantly expanding its public investment budget.	我是中文句子
To be able to grow in the midst of fiscal consolidation, something else has to pull the economy forward, typically exports.	我是中文句子
Instead, the authorities followed a diagnostic approach to prioritize their policies.	我是中文句子
This led to many ideas that proved to be powerful.	我是中文句子
Likewise, consultative groups in manufacturing and tourism identified areas for improvement.	我是中文句子
No wonder that tourism is growing at double-digit rates.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the country’s ambassadors are now being used in a concerted strategy to promote foreign investment through direct engagement with firms.	我是中文句子
The innovations have not been only at the national level.	我是中文句子
Albania’s capital has won European awards for its development of high-quality urban spaces and for solving mobility and environmental problems in innovative ways.	我是中文句子
The lessons for other countries are clear.	我是中文句子
In this process, countries are not alone.	我是中文句子
The system of international financial assistance led by the IMF and the development-finance institutions can be very helpful.	我是中文句子
But countries must figure out when and how best to use them.	我是中文句子
They can enhance government capacity but cannot substitute for government commitment.	我是中文句子
For much of its history, Albania looked hopeless.	我是中文句子
But hopeless is as hopeless does.	我是中文句子
Now Albania’s turnaround is a source of hope for the rest of us.	我是中文句子
Toward a More Reflective Planet	我是中文句子
Climate models have long struggled to duplicate those large fluctuations in sea levels – until now.	我是中文句子
Indeed, for the first time, a high-quality model of Antarctic ice and climate has been able to simulate these large swings.	我是中文句子
That is smart science, but it brings devastating news.	我是中文句子
The new model shows that melting in Antarctica alone could increase global sea levels by as much as one meter (3.2 feet) by the end of this century – well above prior estimates.	我是中文句子
As little as one meter could put at risk entire cities, from Miami to Mumbai, and cause enormous economic disruption.	我是中文句子
We need to turn down the heat – and fast.	我是中文句子
To this end, albedo modification – a kind of geoengineering intended to cool the planet by increasing the reflectivity of the earth’s atmosphere – holds tremendous promise.	我是中文句子
Injecting synthetic aerosols that reflect sunlight into the stratosphere, for example, could help counter the warming caused by greenhouse gases.	我是中文句子
The mechanism is similar to wearing a white shirt in the summer: white reflects sunlight and cools what is underneath, whereas darker colors absorb sunlight and heat.	我是中文句子
To be sure, even in the best-case scenario, solar geoengineering alone could not stabilize the world’s climate.	我是中文句子
For that, we must both stop pumping carbon pollution into the atmosphere and learn how to remove what is already there.	我是中文句子
That is why emissions cuts should receive the lion’s share of resources devoted to combating climate change.	我是中文句子
But, as the recent study shows, emissions cuts alone cannot save the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and prevent a drastic sea-level rise.	我是中文句子
Most of the world’s state-of-the-art climate models have explored albedo modification, and each of them has found that the process does have the potential to mitigate climate change.	我是中文句子
Beyond limiting total warming, it can help to check the rise in peak temperatures, decreasing the risk of destructive heat waves.	我是中文句子
And it seems to be particularly effective at reducing extreme rainfall, which holds profound implications for minimizing flood damage.	我是中文句子
Albedo modification remains uncertain and risky, owing partly to a dearth of organized research into the subject.	我是中文句子
And, in fact, albedo modification would undoubtedly make some things worse.	我是中文句子
But there is not a single climate model run that shows that a moderate intervention would make any region worse off overall.	我是中文句子
In fact, albedo modification is so cheap that direct costs will not be the deciding issue.	我是中文句子
Instead, it is a risk-risk trade-off – one that will require more research to assess.	我是中文句子
Given the lack of knowledge, no sensible person would push for deploying albedo modification today.	我是中文句子
But it would make no sense to ignore its potential.	我是中文句子
After all, no one would argue that we should abandon research on a promising cancer drug because it is unproven.	我是中文句子
It recommended careful research in 1992 and again in 2015.	我是中文句子
Yet no such program exists.	我是中文句子
One reason for this is concern about the diversion of resources from other approaches.	我是中文句子
And, of course, there are tradeoffs.	我是中文句子
But the US, for example, has an annual climate science budget of around $3 billion.	我是中文句子
An exploratory solar geoengineering program, costing only a few tens of millions of dollars per year, is entirely feasible.	我是中文句子
A larger obstacle to progress is fear that more attention to geoengineering solutions would sap motivation to cut emissions.	我是中文句子
China has initiated a limited research program on albedo modification.	我是中文句子
The US has not.	我是中文句子
The US government should take the lead now in researching albedo modification.	我是中文句子
Even if the result was that albedo modification does not work, the dividends of such research would be enormous, owing to the added pressure to cut emissions.	我是中文句子
And if it turned out to be successful, the social, environmental, and economic returns would be tremendous.	我是中文句子
India’s Prohibition Hypocrisy	我是中文句子
The victims were poisoned because this April, in a fit of moralism, Bihar adopted a draconian law prohibiting the sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol.	我是中文句子
It is far from the first such ban that has ended badly.	我是中文句子
In a country where the national hero is the saintly Mahatma Gandhi, who considered alcohol an unmitigated evil, drinking has always carried a whiff of disrepute.	我是中文句子
India’s constitution, in its non-enforceable Directive Principles, urges Indians to work toward prohibition, and the government does not serve alcohol even at state banquets and official receptions.	我是中文句子
But maintaining a sweeping prohibition policy has long proved difficult in India.	我是中文句子
In Manipur in 2002, the 1991 ban was lifted in five hill districts, where alcohol consumption is a centuries-old local tradition.	我是中文句子
Lakshadweep makes an exception for an uninhabited island, where a tourist resort is allowed to operate a bar.	我是中文句子
When I was a child, what was then Bombay excused anyone with a doctor’s note confirming alcoholism.	我是中文句子
(Well-heeled executives tripped over themselves to be labeled alcoholics.)	我是中文句子
It has been backsliding ever since.	我是中文句子
A coastal state, Kerala has long been viewed as a tourist paradise – a reputation no doubt kept afloat on a sea of easily available libations.	我是中文句子
Before the ban, Kerala held a somewhat dubious distinction: India’s highest per capita consumption of spirits.	我是中文句子
So Kerala’s government introduced the ban.	我是中文句子
And, at first, many approved.	我是中文句子
The influential Christian churches applauded the move, as did the Christian-affiliated political parties.	我是中文句子
No public figure of any consequence in Kerala stood up to oppose the decision.	我是中文句子
But there were good reasons to oppose the ban – reasons that had nothing to do with religion, morality, or alcoholism.	我是中文句子
Another 26% of state revenues come from tourism, which would surely also take a hit.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, much of Kerala’s economic viability depends on dynamic knowledge and services sectors.	我是中文句子
Attracting talent and investment from abroad would become much more difficult if prohibition hampered the state’s quality of life.	我是中文句子
(IT professionals in Bangalore, in the neighboring state Karnataka, flock to that city’s bars and pubs after long hours at work.)	我是中文句子
Kerala’s leaders should have known that their state could not afford to do without widely available, heavily taxed liquor.	我是中文句子
But they began to implement the policy anyway.	我是中文句子
Almost immediately, 20,000 bar workers and distillery employees lost their jobs, in a state that already struggles with high unemployment.	我是中文句子
And IT companies contemplating moving to clean, green, tech-friendly Kerala expressed concern about the prohibition policy.	我是中文句子
It was not long before Kerala’s government decided that prohibition would apply only to hard alcohol, and closed bars could reopen as wine and beer parlors.	我是中文句子
So Kerala is no longer hurtling toward disaster in the name of saving people from themselves.	我是中文句子
Four states – Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Mizoram, and Tamil Nadu – have repealed prohibition policies.	我是中文句子
To be sure, not everyone loses out from a prohibition policy.	我是中文句子
In other words, excise duties from Kerala would now fill Tamil Nadu’s coffers.	我是中文句子
Banning alcohol in India has been economically devastating.	我是中文句子
Yet politicians continue to use the promise of prohibition to win votes.	我是中文句子
When elections were called in Tamil Nadu early this year, its chief minister declared herself in favor of prohibition.	我是中文句子
After the election was won, however, all such talk discreetly subsided.	我是中文句子
My late father liked to say: “India is not only the world’s largest democracy; we are also the world’s largest hypocrisy.”	我是中文句子
I suppose we can drink to that.	我是中文句子
Leaders for a Leaderless World	我是中文句子
PARIS – The newspaper commentaries that I write often have a dark perspective.	我是中文句子
Sadly, this one will be no different.	我是中文句子
But there are two pieces of good news that break through the gloom.	我是中文句子
First, the global significance of US President Barack Obama’s reelection is clear: the world has escaped a disaster for international cooperation.	我是中文句子
The US was on the verge of sinking into isolationist nationalism, reinforced, perhaps, by xenophobic sentiment.	我是中文句子
The other piece of good news concerns France, and thus is more “local,” but is crucially important nonetheless.	我是中文句子
Manufacturing production has plummeted, the trade balance has deteriorated sharply, and corporate bankruptcies are increasingly frequent.	我是中文句子
For six months, France has had new leadership – a new president, government, and parliament.	我是中文句子
Many began to wonder whether Hollande was aware of the scope of the crisis that the recent downturn might trigger.	我是中文句子
The VAT increase will hurt, but there was no other way.	我是中文句子
Awareness, boldness, and comprehensive policymaking have come as a relief to French investors, and have left them better positioned to face the crisis.	我是中文句子
The French government’s new push to confront the country’s economic plight matters not only to France, but to Europe and the world as well.	我是中文句子
After all, France is the eurozone’s second-largest economy, and the fifth-largest economy in the world.	我是中文句子
And yet, despite these bright spots, international cooperation on issues ranging from regional conflicts to the protection of global public goods remains weak.	我是中文句子
Antarctica, the only land in the world that is administered directly by the international community, is a recent case in point.	我是中文句子
The Antarctic Treaty, negotiated in 1959, prohibits any and all military activities in Antarctica and forbids the establishment of any borders.	我是中文句子
The principle that international cooperation is required to protect fishery resources, which are dwindling everywhere, was adopted at the 2011 CCAMLR meeting.	我是中文句子
They were compatible and would reinforce one another.	我是中文句子
Yet the discussion foundered, and no decision was taken.	我是中文句子
Russia and Ukraine – and, to a lesser extent, China – blocked efforts to reach an agreement.	我是中文句子
That will not change until a new consciousness emerges worldwide to persuade states to support binding international law.	我是中文句子
The US has now reelected a president who understands this.	我是中文句子
France has a president who understands the need for bold, far-reaching actions as well.	我是中文句子
Their active leadership, and that of others, is needed now more than ever to turn the tide.	我是中文句子
Assured Mutual Dependence	我是中文句子
The growing dependence of countries on one another’s food, water, and energy requires that the global response to sustainability is taken to the highest political level.	我是中文句子
Unlike the nuclear arms race of the twentieth century, the resource-security agenda is not linear.	我是中文句子
Mutually assured destruction was explicitly acknowledged during the Cold War in statements from both sides.	我是中文句子
Countries have become unavoidably interdependent, and climate change, water stress, and the loss of ecological resilience all increase the volatility of this mutual dependence.	我是中文句子
In a world of limited and scarce resources, countries and companies will be forced to make decisions that affect one another’s security.	我是中文句子
The ESI identifies four areas of mutual dependence that will likely shape global security in the coming decades:	我是中文句子
·         Choke points.	我是中文句子
Countries’ growing demand for energy, water, food, and land cannot be satisfied without incurring tradeoffs among limited available resources.	我是中文句子
Choke points are reached when the available resources are insufficient to satisfy demand.	我是中文句子
In China and India, for example, this means that in certain regions there may not be enough water in the short term to run coal-fired thermal power stations and irrigate large fields to grow crops.	我是中文句子
In China, 60% of planned coal-fired power plants will be built in water-stressed regions.	我是中文句子
·         Food.	我是中文句子
The growing dependence of many countries on food, water, and energy imports creates new opportunities for trade and investment, but it also exposes countries to critical vulnerabilities.	我是中文句子
Australia, for example, is a large coal exporter but imports most of its refined fuels and holds just three days of fuel stockpiles.	我是中文句子
The challenges of mutual dependence are particularly acute with respect to food.	我是中文句子
As the ESI shows, some countries – including Egypt, Peru, and the United Arab Emirates – are heavily dependent on cereal imports from a small number of suppliers.	我是中文句子
Moreover, grain suppliers’ exposure to extreme weather may compromise their ability to sustain supplies, with knock-on effects for import-dependent countries.	我是中文句子
In 2010, for example, Russia imposed an export ban on wheat, following a severe drought.	我是中文句子
The resulting food-price increases are believed to have played a role in Egypt’s revolution.	我是中文句子
·         Teleconnections.	我是中文句子
Anticipating systemic ecological risks will be increasingly important for sectors such as reinsurance and infrastructure investments.	我是中文句子
“Teleconnections” refer to weather events that are related to one another over large geographic distances.	我是中文句子
They are well known to science but not properly discussed by the industries, investors, and governments whose security depends on environmental stability.	我是中文句子
For example, tropical rainforests play a crucial function in maintaining stable weather and rainfall, acting as a “pump” that helps moisture travel between different regions.	我是中文句子
Deforestation can thus have a destabilizing effect on weather patterns, amplifying the frequency and severity of extreme events such as floods and droughts.	我是中文句子
The resulting liabilities to key industries and the financial sector are clear.	我是中文句子
In some regions of India, for example, these issues are playing out in tandem.	我是中文句子
Countries and companies will increasingly need to invest in sustainable land in order to hedge their resource risks.	我是中文句子
In 2015, global frameworks are due to be agreed to address climate change, coordinate responses to natural disasters, and guide the world’s development agenda.	我是中文句子
Some of these multilateral processes – in particular, those seeking an ambitious global climate agreement – appear to be moving in slow motion and against the grain of geopolitical interests.	我是中文句子
In the past, the case for high-level nuclear governance was urgent and clear, but required processes for creating a common understanding of risks and opportunities across national borders.	我是中文句子
Here, too, the world will need to create informal platforms that supplement traditional multilateralism.	我是中文句子
In particular, the outdated divisions between rich and poor countries and their responsibilities must be revised.	我是中文句子
Only then will the world be on track to improve the security of all.	我是中文句子
After Aleppo	我是中文句子
DENVER – The end of the fighting in Aleppo will not end the Syrian war, despite the countrywide ceasefire that has just been agreed.	我是中文句子
Nor will it ease the suffering of the city’s population, much of which has been displaced.	我是中文句子
Good diplomacy begins with a keen analysis of interests, both of the country in question and of relevant external powers.	我是中文句子
It demands a careful assessment of how the pursuit of those interests will affect the regional and international order.	我是中文句子
And it seeks ways to strengthen the capacity of regional or world powers to help solve problems.	我是中文句子
The key is to ensure that values do not become weapons, deployed by one actor against another in a way that exacerbates tensions and undermines solutions.	我是中文句子
The conflict erupted in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, at a moment when one set of international organizing principles had collapsed and a new set had not yet been created.	我是中文句子
Partly as a result of this, the conflict was characterized by large-scale civilian carnage and human-rights violations.	我是中文句子
Could the nascent post-Cold War system handle the inchoate problems of the former Soviet Union?	我是中文句子
Could NATO take on new roles and missions?	我是中文句子
Could the West work with the new Russian Federation?	我是中文句子
Could the transatlantic relationship weather the storm?	我是中文句子
The answer to all of these questions turned out to be yes.	我是中文句子
As a result, though the region continues to be beset by serious problems, the gates of hell have remained closed – as they have in Rwanda.	我是中文句子
And yet, just 20 years later, it seems that the world’s collective memory of how to cooperate has failed.	我是中文句子
To be sure, there was never a clear path to peace in Syria.	我是中文句子
The temptation to seek regime change – a goal embraced by the United States and some European countries – was understandable.	我是中文句子
And make no mistake: there are a lot of (often conflicting) opinions and interests.	我是中文句子
It is not the kind of country to which international and regional powers would be indifferent.	我是中文句子
That gave the Assad regime’s allies all the justification they needed to supply weapons of their own.	我是中文句子
Some argue that, if the US had just provided more weapons sooner, Assad would not have had time to galvanize support and hold onto power.	我是中文句子
But that neglects the strategic importance of Syria to so many external powers, as well as the fragmentation and unpredictability of the US-based combatants.	我是中文句子
America’s real mistake was failing to engage with all sides, including Assad and the Sunni opposition, which it deemed sectarian.	我是中文句子
(During the Bosnian War, by contrast, the US talked to rump Yugoslavia’s ruler, Slobodan Milošević.)	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, the conflict rages on, with severe spillover effects on US allies like the European Union.	我是中文句子
As for Russia, it, too, is pursuing a version of diplomacy that utterly lacks inclusiveness.	我是中文句子
Iran will be there.	我是中文句子
But where are the Sunni Arab states?	我是中文句子
More important, where is the US?	我是中文句子
It is often observed that, every four years, the US does without a foreign policy.	我是中文句子
This time, it seems to have gotten an early start.	我是中文句子
Alexander Hamilton’s Eurozone Tour	我是中文句子
PRINCETON – Europe’s debt crisis has piqued Europeans’ interest in American precedents for federal finance.	我是中文句子
For many, Alexander Hamilton has become a contemporary hero.	我是中文句子
Perhaps one day his face should appear on the €10 banknote.	我是中文句子
There were two sides to his case, one practical, the other philosophical.	我是中文句子
“When the credit of a country is in any degree questionable,” he argued, “it never fails to give an extravagant premium upon all the loans it has occasion to make.”	我是中文句子
There is, he maintained, “an intimate connection between public virtue and public happiness.”	我是中文句子
That virtue consisted in honoring commitments, and it would build solidarity in the new political community of the United States.	我是中文句子
Indeed, public virtue made federal finance what he called “the powerful cement of our union.”	我是中文句子
In the American case, however, unity carried a price: a ceiling was imposed on Virginia’s exposure to the common debt.	我是中文句子
Only this inducement to the most powerful state in the union persuaded Madison to drop his opposition to the proposal.	我是中文句子
The US experiment in federalized finance was not immediately successful.	我是中文句子
Two important components of Hamilton’s financial architecture were not realized, or were realized imperfectly.	我是中文句子
Second, opponents eventually blocked his proposal for a national central bank.	我是中文句子
Nor did the Hamiltonian scheme of federal finance guarantee a peaceful commonwealth.	我是中文句子
In fact, the fiscal union proved to be explosive rather than adhesive.	我是中文句子
As international capital markets developed in the early nineteenth century, state governments borrowed on a large scale, quickly turning them from creditors into debtors.	我是中文句子
A wave of state defaults followed in the late 1830’s.	我是中文句子
The federal assumption of states’ debts by itself could not guarantee political order.	我是中文句子
The Civil War revealed the centrality of a common foundation of morality to Hamilton’s approach to debt and public finance.	我是中文句子
As a result, his approach foundered on the differences between the different states’ conception of morality.	我是中文句子
Debt exceeding that amount would be left to the responsibility of the member states.	我是中文句子
Can Navalny Save Russia?	我是中文句子
Yet the revolt was suppressed, and the Decembrists were executed or exiled.	我是中文句子
One doomed officer famously declared, “You can’t hang us all.”	我是中文句子
Russia’s brutal twentieth century, with its totalitarianism and gulags, nearly proved that officer – and de Maistre – wrong.	我是中文句子
No one “deserves” to be ruled so monstrously.	我是中文句子
An estimated 20 million Russians perished under Stalin’s rule, and the rest were paralyzed with terror.	我是中文句子
The twenty-first century has been kinder to Russians, at least so far.	我是中文句子
None of them envisaged rotting in a labor camp like Khodorkovsky.	我是中文句子
Under Putin, it seems, de Maistre’s maxim has received a new lease on life.	我是中文句子
Navalny, a 37-year-old anti-corruption lawyer, has been a thorn in Putin’s side ever since.	我是中文句子
But Navalny’s approval ratings are not far behind, at 80%, and he has achieved them entirely on his own.	我是中文句子
Navalny’s candidacy received a recent boost when he became a convicted criminal, following a trial that resembled Khodorkovsky’s in terms of blatant political manipulation.	我是中文句子
Accused of fraud, Navalny received a five-year prison sentence for allegedly embezzling from Kirovles, a provincial timber company.	我是中文句子
But, in an unusual twist, Navalny was released from custody pending appeal of his conviction only a day after it was handed down.	我是中文句子
That, some say, was because his supporters immediately took to the streets.	我是中文句子
The likelier motivation is that Putin decided to let the election play out, relying on Navalny to lose.	我是中文句子
But what if Navalny is elected?	我是中文句子
Would his sentence be commuted, postponed, or annulled?	我是中文句子
Would he go to prison, Muscovites’ choice notwithstanding?	我是中文句子
Thirty-seven of them signed what they called a new “social contract.”	我是中文句子
According to their manifesto, they “expect Navalny to defend the rule of law, support independent courts, and ensure that officials are really accountable before society.”	我是中文句子
Most of these young entrepreneurs have risen within the “knowledge economy.”	我是中文句子
They include the inventor of a cloud-computing service, the founder of an online luxury-goods business, a developer of new banking technologies, and the creator of a social-networking platform for doctors.	我是中文句子
All of them have good educations, and many hold American business degrees.	我是中文句子
And Putin himself has become an insufferably vulgar embarrassment.	我是中文句子
Indeed, Navalny has become the only hope for competitive politics in Russia.	我是中文句子
At the same time, Navalny’s unapologetic nationalism makes many people nervous.	我是中文句子
And, while Russian leaders may start out as reformers, they do not often remain so.	我是中文句子
So Moscow’s mayoral election is a moment of truth for Navalny, the business leaders investing in his campaign, all Muscovites, and perhaps Russia as a whole.	我是中文句子
As in the time of the Decembrists, anyone in Russia can suffer from overweening government power, regardless of political belief.	我是中文句子
Fear and apathy have become riskier than taking a stand.	我是中文句子
How We Lose Our Marbles	我是中文句子
In the early nineteenth century, the friezes and sculptures were removed from the Parthenon by Lord Elgin, Britain’s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.	我是中文句子
Elgin sold them to the British government, which put them in the British Museum.	我是中文句子
Greece wants them back.	我是中文句子
But the film is of less interest in this dispute than the identity of the characters involved.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the most important question is this: Whom is the public inclined to believe – Clooney or Johnson (or perhaps the Nazis)?	我是中文句子
Of course, one might ask why the people involved should matter at all; surely the facts of the case should speak for themselves.	我是中文句子
And yet, on questions such as this – as with so many important political, social, economic, and cultural issues – what we come to believe is not based on the facts alone, if at all.	我是中文句子
Social and cognitive psychologists have long understood these two basic processes in their study of “dual-process” models, which explain how we process information and eventually form an opinion.	我是中文句子
But in most cases, when people are confronted with matters of great importance, they are more likely to use the so-called central route to information processing, and rightly so.	我是中文句子
Issues of world cultural heritage, for example, deserve conscious, thoughtful deliberation of the facts.	我是中文句子
Indeed, it is our duty, and the very basis of any successful civilization, that important decisions are made only after scrutinizing all relevant information and weighing the relative merits of every position.	我是中文句子
At that point, only one conclusion is possible: The plundered Marbles must be reunited in their historical home and exhibited to the world as the ancient artists intended.	我是中文句子
Persuaded?	我是中文句子
Perhaps not – I am Greek, after all.	我是中文句子
But do not take Clooney’s word for it, either (or Johnson’s).	我是中文句子
Deciding the disposition of the world’s cultural patrimony is not like buying a toaster.	我是中文句子
Living Big Data	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – Big data is made from the digital trail that we leave behind when we use credit cards, mobile phones, or the Web.	我是中文句子
Used carefully and accurately, these data give us unprecedented scope to understand our society, and improve the way we live and work.	我是中文句子
Big data requires us to experiment on a big scale.	我是中文句子
This new capability allows viewers to see, for example, where government initiatives are working or failing.	我是中文句子
One reason is that such rich streams of data encourage spurious correlations.	我是中文句子
Without knowing all possible alternatives, we cannot form a limited, testable set of clear hypotheses.	我是中文句子
And if we can no longer rely on laboratory experiments to test causality, we must test it in the real world, using massive volumes of real-time data.	我是中文句子
One major challenge for a living lab is to protect individual privacy without diminishing the potential for better government.	我是中文句子
If big data is to be deployed effectively, people must be able to understand and interpret the relevant statistics.	我是中文句子
This calls for a new understanding of human behavior and social dynamics that goes beyond traditional economic and political models.	我是中文句子
Only by developing the science and language of social physics will we be able to make a world of big data a world in which we want to live.	我是中文句子
Peril and Promise in Algeria	我是中文句子
MADRID – Five years after the start of the so-called Arab Spring, the hope that initially characterized those revolutions has largely been dashed.	我是中文句子
In many cases, the revolutions have evolved into brutal and protracted internal conflicts, with no solution in sight.	我是中文句子
But Algeria’s fate is back on the world’s radar – and not a moment too soon.	我是中文句子
These steps, in the making since 2011, aim to strengthen Algeria’s democratic standing; but they have been widely criticized as insufficient.	我是中文句子
What is not in doubt is that the reforms come at a sensitive time, when Algeria is plagued by political and economic uncertainty.	我是中文句子
The “consensus” that supposedly shapes Algerian politics has, in fact, paralyzed decision-making for many years now.	我是中文句子
With the ailing Bouteflika not seen in public for more than a year, important questions have emerged about how the 2019 presidential election will play out.	我是中文句子
Significant external challenges have exacerbated Algeria’s situation.	我是中文句子
Falling oil revenues mean that Algeria’s government cannot maintain the broad array of subsidies that traditionally served as a social balm, helping prevent protest.	我是中文句子
The government has already had to increase some taxes, while raising prices for fuel, electricity, and gas.	我是中文句子
If the price of oil does not rise soon, and Algeria’s leaders are forced to take more drastic measures, social stability could be jeopardized.	我是中文句子
But, memories fade as time passes, and a new generation of young people lack the same fear of social strife that their parents and grandparents have.	我是中文句子
In this social context, and if economic hardship persists, protests and even revolt may not be a distant prospect.	我是中文句子
To avoid such an outcome, Algeria’s government must work fast to diversify the economy.	我是中文句子
For example, in Libya, Algeria has defended a process of inclusive national reconciliation of all forces, in support of efforts by the United Nations to stabilize the country.	我是中文句子
The United States and Europe have already recognized Algeria’s leadership and cooperation in anti-terror efforts in its neighborhood.	我是中文句子
One key way Algeria can help improve security cooperation in its region would be to restore diplomatic relations with Morocco.	我是中文句子
True, the countries have been at loggerheads for 40 years, owing to their sovereignty dispute over Western Sahara.	我是中文句子
But the economic, commercial, and security-related dividends that renewed cooperation would provide should be enough to persuade them to reconsider this position.	我是中文句子
If the two North African giants were to recognize their mutual interests and reestablish ties, they would disentangle relations in the Maghreb.	我是中文句子
Algeria’s influence across Africa would also receive a boost.	我是中文句子
Already, Algeria’s Africa-wide influence may be set to grow.	我是中文句子
Some have suggested that an Algerian candidate could become Chair of the Commission of the African Union when the current term expires next July.	我是中文句子
If successful, Algeria would become the first North African country to lead the AU.	我是中文句子
The severe challenge posed by falling oil prices and a jittery regional context attest to the urgent need for change in Algeria.	我是中文句子
The Politics of Machine-Learning Algorithms	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – Around 1200 BC, the Shang Dynasty in China developed a factory system to build thousands of huge bronze vessels for use in everyday life and ritual ceremonies.	我是中文句子
A similarly complex process went into fashioning the famous army of terracotta warriors that Qin Shi Huang, China’s first emperor, unveiled one thousand years later.	我是中文句子
According to the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, the statues “were created using an assembly production system that paved the way for advances in mass production and commerce.”	我是中文句子
Among other things, they seem to have predisposed people to accept bureaucratic structures, a social philosophy emphasizing hierarchy, and a belief that there is a single right way of doing things.	我是中文句子
In the twentieth century, theorists such as Langdon Winner extended this line of thinking to other technologies.	我是中文句子
Today, we can take that thinking even further.	我是中文句子
Consider machine-learning algorithms, the most important general-purpose technology in use today.	我是中文句子
Using real-world examples to mimic human cognitive capacities, these algorithms are already becoming ubiquitous in the workplace.	我是中文句子
A key feature of machine-learning algorithms is that their performance improves with more data.	我是中文句子
As a result, the use of these algorithms creates a technological momentum to treat information about people as recordable, accessible data.	我是中文句子
In particular, machine-learning algorithms run directly counter to individuals’ desire for personal privacy.	我是中文句子
But, unlike communitarians, algorithms are indifferent to social norms.	我是中文句子
Their only concern is to make better predictions, by transforming more and more areas of human life into data sets that can be mined.	我是中文句子
To be sure, algorithmic assessment is not new.	我是中文句子
But, unlike modern machine-learning algorithms, older assessment tools were reasonably well understood.	我是中文句子
They made decisions on the basis of relevant normative and empirical factors.	我是中文句子
For example, it was no secret that accumulating a lot of credit card debit could hurt one’s creditworthiness.	我是中文句子
By contrast, new machine-learning technologies plumb the depths of large data sets to find correlations that are predictive but poorly understood.	我是中文句子
In the workplace, algorithms can track employees’ conversations, where they eat lunch, and how much time they spend on the computer, telephone, or in meetings.	我是中文句子
And with that data, the algorithm develops sophisticated models of productivity that far surpass our commonsense intuitions.	我是中文句子
In an algorithmic meritocracy, whatever the models demand becomes the new standard of excellence.	我是中文句子
Still, technology is not destiny.	我是中文句子
We shape it before it shapes us.	我是中文句子
Business leaders and policymakers can develop and deploy the technologies they want, according to their institutional needs.	我是中文句子
But if we follow the natural flow of algorithmic logic, a more meritocratic and communitarian culture will be inevitable.	我是中文句子
And this steady transformation will have far-reaching implications for our democratic institutions and political structures.	我是中文句子
An ordinary Chinese citizen’s role in political life is largely limited to participation in local elections.	我是中文句子
The country’s leaders, meanwhile, are selected through a meritocratic process, and consider themselves custodians of the people’s welfare.	我是中文句子
Liberal democracies are not likely to shift entirely to such a political system.	我是中文句子
If we want to change course, we will have to put our own political imperatives before those of our technologies.	我是中文句子
A Sunni-Shia Bridge Too Far	我是中文句子
Can the new government restore order and address the many immense challenges that Iraq faces?	我是中文句子
The challenges are indeed daunting.	我是中文句子
But perhaps the most intractable challenge of all is bridging the sectarian rift between the country’s Shia and Sunni citizens.	我是中文句子
Is this a historical aberration, or are Islam’s two largest sects condemned to perpetual mutual hostility?	我是中文句子
Certainly, there have been periods when the two communities have coexisted peacefully.	我是中文句子
By contrast, Sunni-Shia clashes – including killings, arson, and other violence – were common during al-Musta’sim’s rule.	我是中文句子
Politics and power struggles explain much of the violence and mistrust.	我是中文句子
Fear of Iranian-led hegemony, for example, has focused Gulf leaders’ minds on their Shia population’s loyalty.	我是中文句子
Malaysia’s political parties use anti-Shia animus to spread fear, helping to attract votes and consolidate power.	我是中文句子
But political calculation cannot explain everything.	我是中文句子
The US destruction of the Iraqi state brought about a precarious new order that sought to redress years of Sunni dominance by favoring the Shia.	我是中文句子
According to this thesis, the Shia simply reverted to their “historic” role as wreckers and fifth columnists.	我是中文句子
Once the preserve of a handful of scholars, the Ibn al-‘Alqami story now plays a prominent part in today’s Sunni- Shia disputes.	我是中文句子
Social media forums are replete with polemics about the Shia role in assisting both Mongol and US invaders.	我是中文句子
Many even claim that Iraq’s Shia are al-‘Alqami’s descendants, and that Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq’s Prime Minister, is his modern incarnation.	我是中文句子
These diatribes reflect Iraqi’s polarized historical memory.	我是中文句子
Sadly, intolerance has now become a generalized condition.	我是中文句子
There is too little knowledge about other communities’ beliefs and history, and what little exists has been overwhelmed by sectarian anger and its poisonous rhetoric.	我是中文句子
As long as Sunnis and Shia refuse to think about their past together, it is difficult to foresee a tranquil future together.	我是中文句子
Doing so will require knowledge, patience, and, above all, open minds and hearts.	我是中文句子
All in the Family	我是中文句子
MUNICH – Big economic crises often cause iconic companies to falter.	我是中文句子
Rupert Murdoch’s media empire is a model of the modern global enterprise.	我是中文句子
That model is now threatened by the fallout from the scandal that started with phone hacking in Murdoch’s British press operations.	我是中文句子
The Murdoch experience is a microcosm of how modern globalization works.	我是中文句子
Murdoch always looked like a foreign intrusion into British life. It was not just that he was Australian; he also brought new ideas.	我是中文句子
Even more importantly, Murdoch represented a concept of family business that is common in many parts of the world, but relatively rare in Britain and the United States.	我是中文句子
Family capitalism in the continental European model uses relatively little capital to achieve maximum control.	我是中文句子
It frequently depends on very complex corporate structures, with multiple layers of holding companies, as well as privileged shares that can guarantee the continuation of control.	我是中文句子
This sort of firm is also very common in the most dynamic emerging-market economies in Asia and Latin America.	我是中文句子
For decades, academic analysts have been fighting over whether such large-scale family businesses should be considered beneficial.	我是中文句子
At least in the case of the Murdoch empire, it now appears that they pursue long and binding relationships with politicians and the police as well.	我是中文句子
Murdoch’s empire depended on its closeness to politicians.	我是中文句子
In retrospect, three successive British prime ministers – Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron – were on overly familiar terms with a manipulative business leader.	我是中文句子
Cameron now talks about the need for “a healthier relationship between politicians and media owners.”	我是中文句子
And Murdoch apparently is now saying that he wishes that all these prime ministers would “leave me alone.”	我是中文句子
The second notorious weakness of family businesses is the problem of succession.	我是中文句子
When he appeared before the British parliament in July, Rupert Murdoch looked like an old man, remote and out of control.	我是中文句子
In old-style family firms, there is a clear rule of succession that the oldest son takes over.	我是中文句子
But that rule is rightly recognized as being potentially dysfunctional.	我是中文句子
There is obviously no guarantee that the oldest son is the best businessman, and the result could be bitter and ferocious sibling rivalry.	我是中文句子
Such succession disputes become even more acute when there are multiple marriages and multiple sets of competing children.	我是中文句子
The complexities of modern marriage patterns make family life much more fraught, especially when phenomenal power and huge sums of money are involved.	我是中文句子
All three of Murdoch’s marriages have produced children, though those from his current relationship are too young to be considered potential corporate successors.	我是中文句子
In addition, succession planning can become complicated by the emergence of “substitute children” from the company’s management.	我是中文句子
The disintegration of the business empire is then accompanied and amplified by bitter disputes between the children and the substitute children.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the crisis of the Murdoch family’s business empire is neither unique nor unprecedented.	我是中文句子
As a result of globalization, large family firms could increase their size and their geographic range.	我是中文句子
But globalization also increases the chances of backlashes that focus on the vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and mistakes of big family firms.	我是中文句子
All Man’s Land	我是中文句子
NEW DELHI – Ernest Hemingway’s collection of stories, Men without Women, examines tense gender relationships.	我是中文句子
That story, published more than 80 years ago, remains relevant today in India, where female fetuses face severe risks.	我是中文句子
Ratios in the northern states are particularly alarming: only Himachal Pradesh now has a ratio of girls to boys above 900.	我是中文句子
Despite being illegal, ultrasound sex-determination tests are being used across India to identify for abortion extraordinary numbers of healthy female fetuses.	我是中文句子
But there are serious concerns about legal operations, too.	我是中文句子
Genitoplasty – a sex-change operation on newborn girls – is a mushrooming, and deeply disturbing, business in India.	我是中文句子
There’s only one word for it: gendercide.	我是中文句子
Left unchecked, it will leave India’s next generation of men with a severe shortage of women.	我是中文句子
Education and wealth have nothing to do with it – in fact, some of the worst-affected areas are in India’s wealthiest cities.	我是中文句子
However discomfiting a possibility, the real culprit might be Indian culture and tradition itself.	我是中文句子
Perhaps just as important is that sons typically live with their parents even after they are married, and assume responsibility for parents in their old age.	我是中文句子
Daughters, who live with their in-laws after they marry, are viewed as amanat – someone else’s property.	我是中文句子
In short, sons represent income and daughters an expense.	我是中文句子
In the old days, when families typically had 5-10 children, this didn’t matter so much.	我是中文句子
The number of sons and daughters often evened out.	我是中文句子
But, for today’s smaller families, whether the children are two boys or two girls influences everything from financial planning to preparations for old age.	我是中文句子
Many have argued that Indian women should stand up to their families and refuse to abort their daughters.	我是中文句子
But Indian women want male children just as much.	我是中文句子
Unlike Hemingway’s character, they are often more than willing to abort a girl and try for a boy.	我是中文句子
This raises other questions concerning the consequences of a large shortage of girls.	我是中文句子
Will women be valued and treasured?	我是中文句子
Or will the oversupply of men result in more bride trafficking, sexual violence, and female suicides?	我是中文句子
But I doubt it,” he writes.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, there is no instant solution.	我是中文句子
Saving our girls will require radically altering some of Indian society’s family arrangements, traditions, and attitudes.	我是中文句子
And there is no easy way to accomplish this.	我是中文句子
Legislation alone won’t help, for tradition is a law unto itself.	我是中文句子
Hindu religious law, for example, allows a woman to claim an equal share in her parents’ wealth, but few exercise this right.	我是中文句子
Culturally, she feels that she does not have an equal claim on her father’s property.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, India does need new laws – direct and enforceable – that clamp down on the cultural practices that underpin destructive traditions.	我是中文句子
For example, India could enforce a ceiling on wedding expenditure – typically a father’s biggest expense associated with his daughter.	我是中文句子
Constrained from spending on the wedding, he would compensate her differently – perhaps with a larger inheritance.	我是中文句子
Gradually, this would become the norm, and tradition would adjust accordingly.	我是中文句子
(Interestingly, the state of Kerala, whose people adhere to matrilineal inheritance, has among the most equal sex ratios and literacy rates in India.)	我是中文句子
A more radical measure, which some have advocated, would be direction intervene, with the state providing benefits for families with more girls.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the authorities could also penalize families with boys, at least temporarily.	我是中文句子
India imagines herself as a woman – Bharat Mata, or Mother India.	我是中文句子
The irony is that, unless far-reaching changes are made soon, Mother India could eventually be the only woman left in the country.	我是中文句子
All Stimulus Roads Lead to China	我是中文句子
BEIJING – Now that the “green shoots” of recovery have withered, the debate over fiscal stimulus is back with a vengeance.	我是中文句子
But unemployment has risen even faster and further than expected.	我是中文句子
Combine this with the continued fall in housing prices, and it is understandable that consumer spending remains depressed.	我是中文句子
The banks, having been recapitalized only to the extent necessary to keep them afloat, still have weak balance sheets.	我是中文句子
Their consequent reluctance to lend constrains investment.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, state governments, seeing revenues fall as a result of lower taxable incomes last year, are cutting back like mad.	我是中文句子
If there was a case for additional stimulus back in February, that case is even stronger now.	我是中文句子
But the case against additional stimulus is also strong.	我是中文句子
The US federal deficit is an alarming 12% of GDP, and public debt as a share of national income is already projected to double, to 80% of GDP.	我是中文句子
Given all this, more deficit spending will only stoke fears of higher future taxes and inflation.	我是中文句子
It will encourage the reemergence of global imbalances.	我是中文句子
And it will not reassure consumers or investors.	我是中文句子
It is possible to argue the economics both ways, but the politics all point in one direction.	我是中文句子
The US Congress lacks the stomach for another stimulus package.	我是中文句子
It has already faced intense criticism for its failure to get the country’s fiscal house in order.	我是中文句子
A second stimulus simply is not in the cards.	我是中文句子
If there is going to be more aggregate demand, it can come from only one place.	我是中文句子
That place is not Europe or Japan, where debts are even higher than in the US – and the demographic preconditions for servicing them less favorable.	我是中文句子
Rather, it is emerging markets like China.	我是中文句子
The problem is that China has already done a lot to stimulate domestic demand, both through government spending and by directing its banks to lend.	我是中文句子
As a result, its stock market is frothy, and it is experiencing an alarming property boom.	我是中文句子
Through May, property prices were up 18% year on year.	我是中文句子
Understandably, Chinese officials worry about bubble trouble.	我是中文句子
The obvious way to square this circle is to spend more on imports.	我是中文句子
China can purchase more industrial machinery, transport equipment, and steelmaking material, which are among its leading imports from the US.	我是中文句子
This strategy is not without risks.	我是中文句子
Allowing the renminbi to appreciate as a way of encouraging imports may also discourage exports, the traditional motor of Chinese growth.	我是中文句子
And lowering administrative barriers to imports might redirect more spending toward foreign goods than the authorities intend.	我是中文句子
But these are risks worth taking if China is serious about assuming a global leadership role.	我是中文句子
The question is what China will get in return.	我是中文句子
And the answer brings us back, full circle, to where we started, namely to US fiscal policy.	我是中文句子
China is worried that its more than $1 trillion investment in US Treasury securities will not hold its value.	我是中文句子
It wants reassurance that the US will stand behind its debts. It therefore wants to see a credible program for balancing the US budget once the recession ends.	我是中文句子
And, tough talk notwithstanding, the Obama administration has yet to offer a credible roadmap for fiscal consolidation.	我是中文句子
Doing so would reassure American taxpayers worried about current deficits. Just as importantly, it would reassure Chinese policymakers.	我是中文句子
We live in a multipolar world where neither the US nor China is large enough to exercise global economic leadership on its own.	我是中文句子
For China, leadership means assuming additional risks.	我是中文句子
But for this to be tolerable, the US needs to relieve China of existing risks.	我是中文句子
Only by working together can the two countries lead the world economy out of its current doldrums.	我是中文句子
A Long March with China	我是中文句子
BEIJING – US Vice President Joe Biden’s recent four-day visit to China ended on a high note.	我是中文句子
For starters, there is always an attitude problem.	我是中文句子
Even a brawl between the Chinese and a visiting American basketball team is viewed as evidence of China’s aggressive behavior.	我是中文句子
Many Chinese, on the other hand, tend to think that the US is suffering from severe case of conceited superpower syndrome.	我是中文句子
As these Chinese see it, the US has a rather dysfunctional government, but nevertheless insists that its political and economic system is the best in the world, and that everyone should emulate it.	我是中文句子
It is heavily in debt, but cannot stop spending and borrowing.	我是中文句子
It is no longer competitive in manufacturing, but blames others for its huge trade deficit.	我是中文句子
And the world’s only military superpower is often seen within China as trigger-happy when intervening in other countries’ internal affairs.	我是中文句子
Then, there is the issue of trust.	我是中文句子
China’s critics argue that its claims to a peaceful rise are not credible, given the country’s non-democratic, one-party system.	我是中文句子
Any Chinese military move is portrayed as an expansionary and aggressive act that must be contained.	我是中文句子
Any attempts at engagement by Western politicians, such as Biden’s recent trip, are automatically met with doubt and criticism for cozying up to dictators.	我是中文句子
Likewise, for those Chinese who are suspicious of US intentions, conspiracy is always in play.	我是中文句子
They see a declining superpower using economic, military, and diplomatic means in an unrelenting effort to prevent China’s rise.	我是中文句子
Talk of human rights and democracy is nothing but a smoke screen for demonizing China.	我是中文句子
Increased interdependence has not led to better understandings on even some of the most basic issues.	我是中文句子
Are we going to be in a war?	我是中文句子
Are we preparing for a war against each other?”	我是中文句子
To meet these challenges successfully, there is no viable alternative to a positive, continuous, and frank engagement between China and the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
The Chinese economy will continue to grow; the Chinese military will continue to modernize; and the Chinese people will remain united in their Great Power aspirations.	我是中文句子
Only a patient, creative, and consistent engagement strategy will mitigate fears on both sides.	我是中文句子
China’s rise is a fact; the enduring peacefulness of that rise must be a priority for China, its neighbors, the West, and, most importantly, the US.	我是中文句子
Inequality on the Horizon of Need	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – By any economic measure, we are living in disappointing times.	我是中文句子
So it is important to step back and remind ourselves that the “lost decade” that we are currently suffering is not our long-run economic destiny.	我是中文句子
As Paul Krugman recently reminded us, John Maynard Keynes perhaps put it best:	我是中文句子
“This is a nightmare, which will pass away with the morning.	我是中文句子
For the resources of nature and men’s devices are just as fertile and productive as they were.	我是中文句子
The rate of our progress towards solving the material problems of life is not less rapid.	我是中文句子
We were not previously deceived.	我是中文句子
But today we have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle, having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand.	我是中文句子
The result is that our possibilities of wealth may run to waste for a time.”	我是中文句子
But what is our long-run economic destiny?	我是中文句子
Keynes looked forward to a time, perhaps 2050, when everyone (in England, at least) would be able to have the lifestyle of a Keynes.	我是中文句子
We are wiser – and perhaps sadder – than Keynes.	我是中文句子
We know that we want hip replacements and heart transplants and fertility treatment and cheap air travel and central heating and broadband Internet and exclusive beachfront access.	我是中文句子
So the economic problem will certainly be with us for a long time yet.	我是中文句子
But at least we can count on being able to generate a relatively egalitarian middle-class society as we collectively slouch toward our consumerist utopia, right?	我是中文句子
It was Karl Smith of the University of North Carolina who explained to me that this was likely to be wrong.	我是中文句子
The Industrial Revolution brought ideas and energy to the table, but human brains remained the only effective instrumentalities of control.	我是中文句子
As ideas and energy became cheap, the human brains that were their complements became valuable.	我是中文句子
The lesson is clear: the market is not guaranteed by nature to produce a long-run future characterized by a reasonable degree of wealth inequality and relative poverty.	我是中文句子
Unless and until we recognize this fully, we will remain at the mercy of Keynes’s poorly understood “delicate machine.”	我是中文句子
Alpine Schadenfreude	我是中文句子
Not surprisingly, the atmosphere at this year’s World Economic Forum was grim.	我是中文句子
Those who think that globalization, technology, and the market economy will solve the world’s problems seemed subdued.	我是中文句子
Most chastened of all were the bankers.	我是中文句子
And it was not just the bankers who were in the Davos doghouse this year, but also their regulators – the central bankers.	我是中文句子
Anyone who goes to international conferences is used to hearing Americans lecture everyone else about transparency.	我是中文句子
There was still some of that at Davos.	我是中文句子
Had America really told others to bring in American banks to teach them about how to run their business?	我是中文句子
Basle II is dead – at least until memories of the current disaster fade.	我是中文句子
Bankers – and the rating agencies – believed in financial alchemy.	我是中文句子
They thought that financial innovations could somehow turn bad mortgages into good securities, meriting AAA ratings.	我是中文句子
But one lesson of modern finance theory is that, in well functioning financial markets, repackaging risks should not make much difference.	我是中文句子
If we know the price of cream and the price of skim milk, we can figure out the price of milk with 1% cream, 2% cream, or 4% cream.	我是中文句子
It seemed too good to be true – and it was.	我是中文句子
I argued at Davos that central bankers also got it wrong by misjudging the threat of a downturn and failing to provide sufficient regulation.	我是中文句子
They waited too long to take action.	我是中文句子
Normally, a Davos audience would rally to the support of the central bankers.	我是中文句子
This time, a vote at the end of the session supported my view by a margin of three to one.	我是中文句子
It was interesting to see the different cultural attitudes to the crisis on display.	我是中文句子
He would have resigned.	我是中文句子
Deregulation has not worked.	我是中文句子
Until we achieve a better balance between markets and government, the world will continue to pay a high price.	我是中文句子
Effective Altruism	我是中文句子
PRINCETON – Can humans really be motivated by altruism?	我是中文句子
Why should we doubt that some people act altruistically, at least some of the time?	我是中文句子
In evolutionary terms, we can easily understand altruism toward kin and others who can reciprocate our help.	我是中文句子
More objective evidence of altruism buttresses these findings.	我是中文句子
In many countries, the supply of blood for medical purposes relies on voluntary, anonymous donations.	我是中文句子
Worldwide, more than 11 million people have put their names on donor registries for bone marrow, signifying their willingness to donate their marrow to a stranger.	我是中文句子
A small but growing number of people have gone further still, donating a kidney to a stranger.	我是中文句子
There were 177 altruistic donations by living donors in the United States in 2013 and 118 in the United Kingdom in the year to April 2014.	我是中文句子
Then there are those who donate to charity.	我是中文句子
In the US alone, individuals gave $240 billion to charity in 2013.	我是中文句子
Foundations and corporations topped this up to a total of $335 billion, or about 2% of gross national income.	我是中文句子
Myanmar also had the highest percentage of people volunteering time (51%).	我是中文句子
The US did, however, have the highest ranking for “helping a stranger.”	我是中文句子
That, together with a high ranking for volunteering time, led it to tie with Myanmar as the most generous nation in the world.	我是中文句子
Admittedly, not all of this giving is altruistic.	我是中文句子
That gift seems motivated more by a desire for fame than a desire to do good.	我是中文句子
After all, as Geffen presumably knew, the family of Avery Fisher had to be compensated with a payment of $15 million in order to agree to the renaming.	我是中文句子
By contrast, other donors give larger sums, usually to only a handful of charities chosen on the basis of some knowledge about what the charity is doing.	我是中文句子
They want to have a positive impact on the world.	我是中文句子
Their gifts may also make their lives better, but this is not what motivates them.	我是中文句子
The Effective Altruism movement consists of people who give in the latter way, combining the head and the heart.	我是中文句子
Their aim is to do the most good they can with the resources that they are willing to set aside for that purpose.	我是中文句子
Those resources may include a tenth, a quarter, or even half of their income.	我是中文句子
Their altruism may include their time and talents, and influence their choice of career.	我是中文句子
To achieve their aims, they use reason and evidence to ensure that whatever resources they devote to doing good will be as effective as possible.	我是中文句子
Several studies show that people who are generous are typically happier and more satisfied with their lives than those who do not give.	我是中文句子
And other studies show that giving leads to activity in the reward centers of the brain (the areas of the brain that are also stimulated by tasty food and sex).	我是中文句子
But this does not mean that these donors are not altruistic.	我是中文句子
Their direct motive is to help others, and their giving makes them happier only as a consequence of the fact that it does help others.	我是中文句子
If we had more such people, we would have more giving, and that is what we want.	我是中文句子
Testing Times for Alzheimer’s	我是中文句子
LONDON – Alzheimer’s disease is by far the most common cause of dementia and one of the world’s most feared disorders.	我是中文句子
By 2050, there will be 135 million Alzheimer’s sufferers worldwide, a threefold increase from today, with three-quarters of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries.	我是中文句子
Predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s, let alone preventing or curing it, remains an immense challenge.	我是中文句子
Alzheimer’s disease was identified more than a century ago from autopsy results that showed characteristic brain lesions called “amyloid plaques.”	我是中文句子
The disease is more difficult to diagnose in the living.	我是中文句子
But any cure would have to be administered before the plaques form, and years before symptoms of dementia appear.	我是中文句子
Alzheimer’s might be more predictable if scientists had the time and resources to conduct far-reaching longitudinal studies over many years.	我是中文句子
Such studies ideally would involve blood, imaging, memory, and medical tests, as well as detailed lifestyle questionnaires filled out by thousands of young and middle-aged people.	我是中文句子
These studies found that short-term memory may be impaired for up to ten years before an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.	我是中文句子
Major advances have since been made in brain imaging, biochemical analysis, and, perhaps most important, genetic testing.	我是中文句子
Moreover, though international studies of more than 70,000 people have found over 20 other genes linked to Alzheimer’s, their impact is minimal.	我是中文句子
The study showed which tests were able to predict the outcome most accurately decades ahead of onset.	我是中文句子
Fifteen years prior to onset, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed amyloid-beta being deposited in plaques in the brain itself.	我是中文句子
And detailed short-term memory tests were abnormal ten years before onset, as suggested in the Framingham and Kungsholmen studies.	我是中文句子
These tests are now becoming part of clinical practice, and are available commercially.	我是中文句子
Scientists are therefore still searching for an accurate predictive test that is cheaper, quicker, and less invasive than PET scans or lumbar punctures.	我是中文句子
That will be our next great challenge.	我是中文句子
Africa’s Necessary Data Revolution	我是中文句子
That makes sense.	我是中文句子
Assessing the international community’s next development agenda, regardless of its details, will be impossible without accurate data.	我是中文句子
Indeed, of the 60 countries with complete vital statistics, not one is in Africa.	我是中文句子
Inaccurate data can have serious consequences.	我是中文句子
Consider Nigeria’s experience earlier this year, when GDP rebasing showed that the economy was nearly 90% larger than previously thought.	我是中文句子
The distorted picture of Nigeria’s economy provided by the previous statistics likely led to misguided decisions regarding private investment, credit ratings, and taxation.	我是中文句子
Contrary to popular belief, the constraints on the production and use of basic data stem not from a shortage of technical capacity and knowhow, but from underlying political and systemic challenges.	我是中文句子
For starters, national statistical offices often lack the institutional autonomy needed to protect the integrity of data, production of which thus tends to be influenced by political forces and special interest groups.	我是中文句子
Poorly designed policies also undermine the accuracy of data.	我是中文句子
Without effective oversight, these well-intentioned efforts to reward progress can go awry.	我是中文句子
Despite these failings, national governments and international donors continue to devote far too few resources to ensuring the collection of adequate data.	我是中文句子
And governments’ dependency on donors to fund and gather their core statistics is unsustainable.	我是中文句子
Developing such systems is an ambitious but achievable goal.	我是中文句子
All that is needed is a willingness to experiment with new approaches to collecting, using, and sharing data.	我是中文句子
This is where the public comes in.	我是中文句子
The recognition by governments and external donors of the need for more – and more efficient – funding, particularly to national statistical systems, will be integral to such a shift.	我是中文句子
In fact, tying progress on those metrics to funding via pay-for-performance agreements could improve development outcomes considerably.	我是中文句子
One concrete strategy to achieve these goals would be to create a country-donor compact for better data.	我是中文句子
Such a compact would enable governments and donors to express their shared intention to build a national statistics system over a period of several years, with clear and verifiable milestones.	我是中文句子
In short, a data compact would help to mobilize and focus domestic and donor funding to achieve national statistical priorities.	我是中文句子
Data are the currency of performance, accountability, and credibility in the global economy, and improvements in data have been linked to better governance and higher levels of private investment.	我是中文句子
That is just what Africa needs to support a new decade of growth and development.	我是中文句子
The Experts’ Advantage	我是中文句子
LONDON – Nearly everyone who sits on Google’s board of directors has at least one computer science or engineering degree or doctorate.	我是中文句子
For Google, it pays to have technical expertise at the top.	我是中文句子
But Google is an unusual corporate giant in promoting those with scientific prowess to the top of the management ladder.	我是中文句子
Beyond Silicon Valley, few senior corporate executives boast technical expertise in the products that their companies produce.	我是中文句子
Nowadays, it seems as anomalous to have knowledge workers serve as professional leaders as it once did to have scientists in the boardroom.	我是中文句子
“Medicine should be left to the doctors,” according to a common refrain, “and organizational leadership should be left to professional managers.”	我是中文句子
But this is a mistake.	我是中文句子
Research shows that higher-performing US hospitals are likely to be led by doctors with outstanding research reputations, not by management professionals.	我是中文句子
The evidence also suggests that hospitals perform better, and have lower death rates, when more of their managers up to board level are clinically trained.	我是中文句子
We see similar findings in other fields.	我是中文句子
Departmental-level analysis supports this.	我是中文句子
A university economics department, for example, tends to perform better the more widely its head’s own research is cited.	我是中文句子
With experts in charge, it may not always look like there is an effective reporting structure in place.	我是中文句子
But, as the academic saying goes: just because you cannot herd cats, does not mean there is not a feline hierarchy.	我是中文句子
As with cats, academics operate a “relative hierarchy” in which the person in charge changes, depending on the setting.	我是中文句子
Even in the world of sports, where success is not an obvious preparation for management, we see interesting linkages between experience and organizational performance.	我是中文句子
The very best NBA basketball players often make top coaches, while former Formula 1 champion drivers are associated with great team performance.	我是中文句子
Of the 92 soccer clubs in the English football league, club managers played an average of 16 years in senior clubs.	我是中文句子
Alex Ferguson, arguably Britain’s best manager, scored an average of one goal every two games in his professional career.	我是中文句子
But where the pattern does occur, especially in the business world, we should take note.	我是中文句子
The senior partner of any professional services firm is likely to have been a top performer during a long career with the firm.	我是中文句子
The leader’s credibility is vital: if she sets high standards, it seems only right that she should have matched or exceeded them herself.	我是中文句子
In short, she must lead by example.	我是中文句子
This sort of leadership arrangement creates a virtuous circle.	我是中文句子
A leader with prior experience knows how her subordinates feel, how to motivate them, and how to create the right working environment.	我是中文句子
The problem, however, is not simply that today’s leaders lack technical knowledge; it is that experts are often reluctant to lead.	我是中文句子
But that can change.	我是中文句子
Many medical schools are already considering including management education as part of the curriculum.	我是中文句子
The trick is to get experts, who are trained to go ever deeper into their specialization, to step back and view the big picture.	我是中文句子
With the right preparation, there is no reason why a leader cannot specialize and manage.	我是中文句子
The results could be remarkable.	我是中文句子
Think of how governments run by scientists with management skills might respond to climate change.	我是中文句子
Top minds should be put to top use.	我是中文句子
A Mania for Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder	我是中文句子
Even patients who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after initially seeking treatment for the correct diagnosis to be made.	我是中文句子
To be sure, we have also seen patients seeking treatment for depression who really did have bipolar disorder.	我是中文句子
However, there seemed to be more over-diagnosis than under-diagnosis.	我是中文句子
We therefore conducted a study to examine empirically how often bipolar disorder might be over- and under-diagnosed.	我是中文句子
Family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate relatives.	我是中文句子
Less than half of those who reported that they had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on the SCID.	我是中文句子
Patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID did not have a significantly higher risk for bipolar disorder than the patients who were negative for bipolar disorder by self-report and the SCID.	我是中文句子
Our findings, validated by family history, thus suggest that bipolar disorder was over-diagnosed.	我是中文句子
Any study seeking to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it upon re-interview.	我是中文句子
Such is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis.	我是中文句子
The question, then, is not whether some patients previously given a diagnosis do not seem to have it upon re-interview, but rather how many.	我是中文句子
How high the percentage should be before claiming over-diagnosis is a significant problem and a value judgment.	我是中文句子
But we think that an over-diagnosis rate of more than 50% crosses the clinical significance threshold.	我是中文句子
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder has costs.	我是中文句子
Thus, over-diagnosing bipolar disorder can unnecessarily expose patients to serious side-effects of medication.	我是中文句子
The impact of marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies and publicity probably plays a role in the emerging tendency to over-diagnose bipolar disorder.	我是中文句子
Direct-to-consumer advertisements that refer individuals to screening questionnaires can result in patients suggesting to their doctors that they have bipolar disorder.	我是中文句子
We have seen evidence of this in our practice.	我是中文句子
This does not necessarily reflect a problem with the performance of a screening questionnaire, but rather how these scales are used.	我是中文句子
Screening questionnaires maximize sensitivity, at a cost of false positives, because it is presumed that they are followed by expert clinical evaluation.	我是中文句子
But insufficient diagnostic rigor can result in over-diagnosis.	我是中文句子
Clinicians are inclined to diagnose disorders that they feel more comfortable treating.	我是中文句子
The results of our study are consistent with prior studies suggesting possible problems with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.	我是中文句子
Both can have negative consequences.	我是中文句子
While there is still some uncertainty as to the best assessment approach, we recommend that clinicians use a standardized, validated method.	我是中文句子
When Tweets Trump Diplomacy	我是中文句子
NEW DELHI – Diplomacy often witnesses unusual spats.	我是中文句子
In just a few 140-character messages, Swaraj denounced the company and threatened to cancel its employees’ visas and refuse visas to its executives in the future.	我是中文句子
What provoked Swaraj’s outburst was a Twitter user’s complaint to her that the Amazon Canada website offered for sale doormats depicting the Indian flag.	我是中文句子
Amazon was swift to respond.	我是中文句子
Less than 24 hours after the doormat crisis erupted, the matter was defused.	我是中文句子
But the episode raises a number of broader issues that won’t disappear so quickly.	我是中文句子
The first issue is Swaraj’s use of Twitter.	我是中文句子
I certainly do not oppose the use of Twitter by public officials.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, I view the growing comfort of government ministers with social media as a matter for celebration.	我是中文句子
That a foreign minister would respond to a Twitter complaint on such trivial matters, some would argue, seems to indicate that she lacks more important things to do.	我是中文句子
But the problem extends beyond Swaraj’s communication with ordinary citizens.	我是中文句子
Such a move is unprecedented, and not particularly welcome.	我是中文句子
Social media is no substitute for a diplomatic cable.	我是中文句子
Also less than diplomatic was the language Swaraj used in her warning to the company.	我是中文句子
“Amazon must tender unconditional apology,” she tweeted.	我是中文句子
“They must withdraw all products insulting our national flag immediately.	我是中文句子
If this is not done forthwith, we will not grant Indian Visa to any Amazon official. We will also rescind the Visas issued earlier.”	我是中文句子
A profession famed for summoning ambassadors for a discreet dressing-down has been reduced to upbraiding companies on Twitter.	我是中文句子
But Indians have a particularly low threshold for what qualifies as disrespect.	我是中文句子
And it’s not just the flag.	我是中文句子
Two years earlier, the company’s website had caused similar outrage by selling women’s leggings with images of Hindu gods.	我是中文句子
So Amazon is no stranger to the anger of offended Indians.	我是中文句子
China has already proved that it can dictate terms to multinationals that covet its vast market.	我是中文句子
India, it seems, will follow suit.	我是中文句子
But whoever has emerged as the winner of the doormat debacle – outraged Twitter users, perhaps – diplomacy has been the loser.	我是中文句子
Ambivalent Arabia	我是中文句子
A democratic tide seems to be sweeping across the Arab world.	我是中文句子
Even the traditional Arab monarchies and Emirates are changing in its wake.	我是中文句子
Their crime was to call for a constitutional monarchy.	我是中文句子
The petition called for the monarchy to work within constitutionally prescribed limits, and for an independent judiciary.	我是中文句子
Only a constitution, they argue, can restore much needed legitimacy to a political system that is widely perceived as deeply corrupt and inept.	我是中文句子
He received these proposals with a warm welcome in January 2003.	我是中文句子
Crown Prince Abdullah offered not a peep of opposition, leaving the reform agenda that he initiated in a political netherworld.	我是中文句子
Of the thirteen reformers who were arrested, ten submitted to this demand, but the other three refused and have paid the price.	我是中文句子
They remained in jail in Riyadh without legal representation until the final verdict.	我是中文句子
Those who submitted had their passports withdrawn, lost their jobs, and were forbidden to speak to the press.	我是中文句子
These entire female population was excluded, and only one-quarter of the male population was eligible to vote.	我是中文句子
Inevitably, Wahhabi Islamists did best.	我是中文句子
The al-Saud face two threats: one from violent Islamists, and the other from liberal reformers.	我是中文句子
There is every indication that they fear the reformers far more.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the princes believe that it is easier to kill “terrorist” criminals than to crush demands for social justice.	我是中文句子
Indeed, killing violent Islamists and al-Qaeda affiliates is applauded by the international community, especially the United States, as success in the “war on terrorism.”	我是中文句子
But as they hunt down and kill violent domestic extremists, they are quietly tightening the noose around all those who want moderate reform.	我是中文句子
This repression of liberal reformers passes unnoticed in the wider world, with America’s silence particularly noticeable.	我是中文句子
This silence is vital to the princes, for what the al-Saud care about most is US support.	我是中文句子
As things stand in Saudi Arabia, the US administration has no credible ally for change outside of the existing regime.	我是中文句子
So, unlike in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgizstan, and Lebanon, it does nothing to encourage popular opposition.	我是中文句子
But turning a blind eye is shortsighted, for America and for the Saudis.	我是中文句子
Those who make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable.	我是中文句子
The liberal reformers who have been jailed could have paved the way for a peaceful transition to a reformed Saudi Arabia.	我是中文句子
By jailing them, the regime has made it clear that violence is the only avenue open to those seeking change.	我是中文句子
Algeria’s Dying Dictatorship	我是中文句子
Under Bouteflika’s leadership, Algeria’s government has failed to address the country’s most pressing economic and social challenges.	我是中文句子
And there is no reason to expect this to change.	我是中文句子
Since suffering a stroke last year, Bouteflika has barely appeared in public, whether to campaign ahead of the vote or to acknowledge his victory after it.	我是中文句子
As a result, the regime is finding it increasingly difficult to claim, as it has for the last 15 years, that Bouteflika’s leadership represents civilian control over the military.	我是中文句子
So it has devised a new strategy, aimed at creating a sense of transition: the constitution will be revised to designate a vice president as the president’s legitimate successor.	我是中文句子
Of course, the move’s true purpose will be to allow the army to rally around the next compliant “civilian leader.”	我是中文句子
The regime will also propose a “national contract,” supposedly to initiate a dialogue with the opposition.	我是中文句子
But, in the wake of Bouteflika’s bogus victory, the opposition can no longer accept a sham role in the regime’s reform plans.	我是中文句子
When the election results were announced, they swiftly rejected the new government as illegitimate.	我是中文句子
But, to gain credibility, the opposition parties will have to extend their criticism beyond Bouteflika to the system as a whole.	我是中文句子
This has become crucial to their survival, as younger opponents are seeking new ways to bring about political change outside state-controlled politics.	我是中文句子
One important development is the growing influence of non-partisan voices of dissent.	我是中文句子
Non-violent movements have formed to protest not only Bouteflika’s continued leadership, but also the pervasive role of the army and intelligence services in civil society.	我是中文句子
Moreover, young people have assumed a prominent role in opposition efforts, such as by disrupting Bouteflika’s campaign rallies.	我是中文句子
By organizing peaceful protests to demand accountability for public spending, these movements are raising issues that were not addressed during the election campaign.	我是中文句子
More immediately, they are also challenging the government’s ban on street demonstrations – a vestige of the state of emergency that lasted from 1992 until 2011.	我是中文句子
With the civil war of the 1990’s long over, security officials cannot explain why Algerians are being arrested for demanding jobs.	我是中文句子
Of course, repression continues to intimidate many Algerians.	我是中文句子
But it is becoming increasingly easy to rouse their sympathy for their fellow citizens through Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.	我是中文句子
By stimulating daily public debate about local human-rights violations, they spread the message of discontent more efficiently than traditional parties ever have.	我是中文句子
Thus, even without explicitly talking about politics, ordinary Algerians are mobilizing in growing numbers against the government.	我是中文句子
For some, the right to make a living through the informal market would be sufficient.	我是中文句子
More than 150 Algerians have even set themselves on fire since 2011, usually in front of public services buildings.	我是中文句子
In this context, the failure of the government’s half-baked attempts to buy off protesters is unsurprising.	我是中文句子
But the decision to prolong Bouteflika’s presidency will not provide the kind of strong, transformational leadership that Algeria needs to materialize the regime’s stability promises.	我是中文句子
The Algerian authorities face a major challenge, because rejection of pluralist institutions makes it more difficult to find negotiating partners.	我是中文句子
The more the regime tries to buy off the protesters, the more overweening it appears – and the angrier citizens become.	我是中文句子
And the enraged younger generation, in particular, is not especially fearful of losing the limited benefits offered by the status quo.	我是中文句子
America After the Election	我是中文句子
The contest has exposed deep fault lines within American society and damaged the country’s global reputation.	我是中文句子
No surprise, then, that one of the few things Americans seem to agree on is that the campaign has gone on for too long.	我是中文句子
But soon it will be over.	我是中文句子
The question is: what comes next?	我是中文句子
Polls suggest that Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, will defeat the controversial Trump.	我是中文句子
But polls are not to be confused with reality.	我是中文句子
After all, going into June’s Brexit referendum, most observers believed that a victory for “Remain” was a sure thing.	我是中文句子
More recently, Colombian voters rejected a peace accord that was widely expected to receive popular approval.	我是中文句子
All of this is to say that, while a Clinton victory may be likely, it is no certainty.	我是中文句子
The only poll that counts is the one on November 8.	我是中文句子
Until then, all we can do is speculate.	我是中文句子
Yet some predictions can be made with greater confidence.	我是中文句子
Neither Democrats nor Republicans will be able to realize their objectives without at least some support from the other.	我是中文句子
But no one should think that the only divide in American politics is between Republicans and Democrats.	我是中文句子
This makes compromise on centrist positions all the more difficult to achieve.	我是中文句子
The rapid resumption of presidential politics will undermine compromise further.	我是中文句子
If Clinton wins, many Republicans will assume that it was only because of Trump’s flaws, and they will judge her likely to be a one-term president.	我是中文句子
A country favoring change, they will conclude, is unlikely to keep a Democrat in the Oval Office for a fourth term.	我是中文句子
Given how much of Trump’s agenda his fellow policymakers would likely find objectionable, governing would be very difficult during his administration.	我是中文句子
In either scenario, it may still be possible to make progress in a few key areas.	我是中文句子
It might also be able to cobble together a majority to reform the US tax code – in particular, lowering the high rate for corporations and raising taxes on the wealthy.	我是中文句子
There could even be some reform of health care, President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, owing to serious implementation problems with the current system.	我是中文句子
But other issues requiring cooperation between Congress and the president are unlikely to be addressed any time soon.	我是中文句子
One is immigration reform, which is as controversial in the US as it is in Europe.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, America’s deficit and debt are certain to rise, as there seems to be little or no will to reduce entitlement spending.	我是中文句子
The foreign-policy implications of the election are somewhat different, because, under the US Constitution, the president enjoys considerable latitude.	我是中文句子
While only Congress can officially declare war or ratify treaties, presidents may use (or refuse to use) military force without explicit congressional approval.	我是中文句子
It is more difficult to guess what Trump would do.	我是中文句子
He is, after all, a political outsider, so no one knows how much of his campaign rhetoric would be translated into policy.	我是中文句子
Still, one could anticipate a Trump administration distancing itself from some traditional allies in Europe and Asia and standing mostly aloof from the Middle East.	我是中文句子
What exactly will happen to America after the presidential election remains an open question.	我是中文句子
America and Europe	我是中文句子
But it would take a medium-sized political miracle for these hopes not to be disappointed, and such a miracle will not happen – whoever is elected.	我是中文句子
The Bush administration made numerous foreign-policy blunders with far-reaching consequences.	我是中文句子
But Bush neither invented American unilateralism nor triggered the transatlantic rift between the United States and Europe.	我是中文句子
As long as America remains the sole world power, the next US President will be neither able nor willing to change the basic framework of America’s foreign policy.	我是中文句子
It will, of course, be important who wins the presidency: a candidate expected to continue Bush’s foreign policy or someone ready for a new beginning.	我是中文句子
In the former case, the transatlantic rift will deepen dramatically.	我是中文句子
Four, or even eight, more years of US policy à la Bush would inflict such damage on the substance of the transatlantic alliance as to threaten its very existence.	我是中文句子
That is the good news.	我是中文句子
To this common agenda, the Europeans should add Africa, climate change, and reform of the United Nations and the world trading system.	我是中文句子
For a long time, Europe has underestimated its weight and importance.	我是中文句子
Europe’s geopolitical, economic, and social weight is quite obvious.	我是中文句子
But Europe’s integration of sovereign states’ interests by means of common institutions could also be an example for much of the world.	我是中文句子
This modern, progressive, and peaceful model is unique and superior to all other currently available approaches to the fundamental questions of political order.	我是中文句子
But could doesn’t mean will.	我是中文句子
Europe’s global influence is feeble because of its internal quarrels and lack of unity, which render the European Union weak and limit its ability to act.	我是中文句子
Objectively strong, subjectively infirm – that is how the EU’s present condition can be described.	我是中文句子
In light of these developments, does it still make sense to speak of “the West”?	我是中文句子
I believe it does, more than ever, because the rift between Europe and America leaves both sides substantially weaker in global terms.	我是中文句子
The unilateral overstretching of American power offers a chance for a new beginning in US-European relations.	我是中文句子
America, more than in the past, will depend on strong partners and will seek such partnerships.	我是中文句子
So what are the Europeans waiting for?	我是中文句子
A regular mutual presence of the Secretary General of NATO and of the head of EU foreign policy in the councils of both organizations doesn’t require much time and effort.	我是中文句子
Why not have routine annual meetings between the European Council and the US President?	我是中文句子
The fate of the Kyoto Protocol should be a lesson to all parties involved.	我是中文句子
No such US-EU consultations would require any new agreements, so they could start without any further preliminaries.	我是中文句子
And that is a good thing.	我是中文句子
The new transatlantic formula must be greater say in decision-making in exchange for a greater share of responsibility.	我是中文句子
America at Stall Speed?	我是中文句子
NEWPORT BEACH – Judging from the skittishness of both markets and “consensus expectations,” the United States’ economic prospects are confusing.	我是中文句子
This situation is both understandable and increasingly unsettling for America’s well-being and that of the global economy.	我是中文句子
As a result, there are now legitimate questions about the underlying functioning of the US economy and, therefore, its evolution in the months and years ahead.	我是中文句子
For the Dreamliner to take off, ascend, and maintain a steady altitude, it must do more than move forward.	我是中文句子
Failure would mean succumbing to a mid-air stall, with tepid forward motion giving way to a sudden loss of altitude.	我是中文句子
Unless we are convinced of the Dreamliner’s ability to avoid stall speed, it makes no sense to talk about all the ways in which it will enhance the travel experience for millions of people around the world.	我是中文句子
America’s economy today risks stall speed.	我是中文句子
Stall speed is a terrifying risk for an economy like that of the US, which desperately needs to grow robustly.	我是中文句子
The private sector alone cannot and will not counter the risk of stall speed.	我是中文句子
What is desperately needed is better policymaking.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, this has been far from the case in America (and in Europe, where the situation is worse).	我是中文句子
This is where the insights of Steve Jobs, one of the world’s best innovators and entrepreneurs, come in.	我是中文句子
Jobs did more than navigate paradigm shifts; he essentially created them.	我是中文句子
He was a master at converting the complicated into the simple; and, rather than being paralyzed by complexity, he found new ways to deconstruct and overcome it.	我是中文句子
Teamwork was an obligation, not a choice.	我是中文句子
And he eschewed the search for the single “big bang” in favor of aiming for multiple breakthroughs.	我是中文句子
Underlying it all was a willingness to evolve – a drive for perfection through experimentation.	我是中文句子
Moreover, he excelled at selling to audiences worldwide both his vision and his strategy for realizing it.	我是中文句子
So far, America’s economic policymakers have fallen short on all of these fronts.	我是中文句子
No surprise that they have yet to find it.	我是中文句子
Teamwork has repeatedly fallen hostage to turf wars and political bickering.	我是中文句子
This is an atmosphere in which unhealthy balance sheets come under even greater pressure, and healthy investors refuse to engage.	我是中文句子
America, China, and the Productivity Paradox	我是中文句子
The productivity paradox seemed to be resolved in the 1990s, when America experienced a spectacular productivity renaissance.	我是中文句子
The benefits of the Internet Age had finally materialized.	我是中文句子
Concern about the paradox all but vanished.	我是中文句子
But the celebration appears to have been premature.	我是中文句子
Despite another technological revolution, productivity growth is slumping again.	我是中文句子
And this time the downturn is global in scope, affecting the world’s two largest economies, the US and China, most of all.	我是中文句子
Over the past five years, from 2010 to 2014, annual US productivity growth has fallen to an average of 0.9%.	我是中文句子
It actually fell at a 2.6% annual rate in the two most recent quarters (in late 2014 and early 2015).	我是中文句子
Barring a major data revision, America’s productivity renaissance seems to have run into serious trouble.	我是中文句子
China is witnessing a similar pattern.	我是中文句子
Moreover, hiring seems to be holding at that brisk pace in early 2015.	我是中文句子
At the same time, output growth has slowed from the 10% trend of the 33 years ending in 2011 to around 7% today.	我是中文句子
That downshift, in the face of sustained rapid job creation, implies an unmistakable deceleration of productivity.	我是中文句子
Therein lies the latest paradox.	我是中文句子
As a modern-day Solow might say, the ���Internet of Everything” is everywhere except in the productivity statistics.	我是中文句子
But is there really a paradox?	我是中文句子
But this overlooks a much more important aspect of the productivity-measurement critique: the undercounting of work time associated with the widespread use of portable information appliances.	我是中文句子
Productivity growth is not about working longer; it is about generating more output per unit of labor input.	我是中文句子
Any undercounting of output pales in comparison with the IT-assisted undercounting of working hours.	我是中文句子
China’s productivity slowdown is probably more benign.	我是中文句子
It is an outgrowth of the Chinese economy’s nascent structural transformation from capital-intensive manufacturing to labor-intensive services.	我是中文句子
Indeed, it was only in 2013 that services supplanted manufacturing and construction as the economy’s largest sector.	我是中文句子
Now the gap is widening, and that is likely to continue.	我是中文句子
China has time before this becomes a problem.	我是中文句子
As Gordon notes, there have been long-lasting productivity dividends associated with urbanization – a trend that could continue for at least another decade in China.	我是中文句子
But there will come a time when this tailwind subsides and China begins to converge on the so-called frontier of the advanced economies.	我是中文句子
At that point, China will face the same productivity challenges that confront America and others.	我是中文句子
Chinese policymakers’ new focus on innovation-led growth seems to recognize this risk.	我是中文句子
Without powerful innovations, sustaining productivity growth will be an uphill battle.	我是中文句子
China’s recent shift to a slower-productivity trajectory is an early warning of what may well be one of its most daunting economic challenges.	我是中文句子
There is no escaping the key role that productivity growth plays in any country’s economic performance.	我是中文句子
Yet, for advanced economies, periods of sustained rapid productivity growth have been the exception, not the rule.	我是中文句子
Recent signs of slowing productivity growth in both the US and China underscore this reality.	我是中文句子
For a world flirting with secular stagnation, that is disturbing news, to say the least.	我是中文句子
A New Blueprint for US-China Relations	我是中文句子
What makes the Sino-American relationship dangerous is that powerful forces in both countries seem intent on a collision course.	我是中文句子
It has pursued manifestly expansionist territorial claims, most notably in the South China Sea, and shown a clear determination to resist the indefinite continuation of American dominance in the region.	我是中文句子
The prevailing Chinese mindset is that the US is intent on isolating, containing, and undermining it.	我是中文句子
Unhappily, there is plenty of evidence on the US side to feed that sentiment.	我是中文句子
They say this is not a “containment” strategy, but it amounts to nothing less.	我是中文句子
Is there another way to manage the relationship that, while reflecting the reality of these forces and mindsets on both sides, would not risk turning legitimate competition into dangerous confrontation?	我是中文句子
It’s a clunky label, but his analysis and policy prescriptions are compelling.	我是中文句子
They will defy easy solutions – and thus will require very careful management.	我是中文句子
Rudd argues that they are wrong, and that Xi will neither overplay his authoritarian hand nor under-deliver on growth.	我是中文句子
China’s rise will continue, and the world – including the US – will have to find principled ways of peacefully accommodating it.	我是中文句子
Rudd’s recommendations are undoubtedly ambitious.	我是中文句子
No American presidential candidate is likely to be comfortable talking about the US as anything other than Number One.	我是中文句子
But we must hope that in the years ahead we hear less talk of “primacy” and “dominance” and much more about cooperation and collaboration.	我是中文句子
It is only with such US policies toward China that the world can begin to be confident that the twenty-first century will not, like the last, become a vale of tears.	我是中文句子
A Bilateral Foil for America’s Multilateral Dilemma	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – The good news is that the United States and China appear to have backed away from the precipice of a trade war.	我是中文句子
While vague in detail, a May 19 agreement defuses tension and commits to further negotiation.	我是中文句子
There is a longstanding disconnect between bilateral and multilateral approaches to international economic problems.	我是中文句子
Hoover ignored the advice, and the global trade war that followed made a garden-variety depression “great.”	我是中文句子
President Donald Trump has put a comparable spin on what it takes to “make America great again.”	我是中文句子
Politicians have long favored the bilateral perspective, because it simplifies blame: you “solve” problems by targeting a specific country.	我是中文句子
By contrast, the multilateral approach appeals to most economists, because it stresses the balance-of-payments distortions that arise from mismatches between saving and investment.	我是中文句子
This contrast between the simple and the complex is an obvious and important reason why economists often lose public debates.	我是中文句子
The dismal science has never been known for clarity.	我是中文句子
Such is the case with the US-China debate.	我是中文句子
China is an easy political target.	我是中文句子
After all, it accounted for 46% of America’s colossal $800 billion merchandise trade gap in 2017.	我是中文句子
The counter-argument from multilateral-focused economists like me rings hollow in this climate.	我是中文句子
Trade deficits, goes the argument, lead to job losses and wage compression.	我是中文句子
As a result, targeting China has enormous political appeal.	我是中文句子
So, what can be made of the May 19 deal?	我是中文句子
Beyond a ceasefire in tit-for-tat tariffs, there are few real benefits.	我是中文句子
US negotiators are fixated on targeted reductions of around $200 billion in the bilateral trade imbalance over a two-year time frame.	我是中文句子
Indeed, with budget deficits likely to widen, America’s saving shortfall will only deepen in the years ahead.	我是中文句子
That points to rising balance-of-payments and multilateral trade deficits, which are impossible to resolve through targeted bilateral actions against a single country.	我是中文句子
China’s vague promise to purchase more American-made agricultural and energy products borrows a page from the “shopping list” approach of its earlier trade missions to the US.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, the big-wallet mindset of a deal-hungry China reinforces the US narrative that China is guilty as charged.	我是中文句子
The goal of achieving back-to-back annual reductions totaling more than double that magnitude is sheer fantasy.	我是中文句子
In the end, any effort to impose a bilateral solution on a multilateral problem will backfire, with ominous consequences for American consumers.	我是中文句子
Without addressing the shortfall in domestic saving, the bilateral fix simply moves the deficit from one economy to others.	我是中文句子
Therein lies the cruelest twist of all.	我是中文句子
China is America’s low-cost provider of imported consumer goods.	我是中文句子
As Hoover’s ghost might ask, what’s so great about that?	我是中文句子
America Confronts Old and New Europe	我是中文句子
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's petulant remark of last year about "old and new Europe" was right for the wrong reasons.	我是中文句子
He meant it to refer to Europe's divisions, but in May, ten additional states joined the European Union.	我是中文句子
The expanded Europe truly forms a new Europe.	我是中文句子
Should America be nervous?	我是中文句子
Fifty-four years after the announcement of the Schuman Plan that began to knit together the economies of France and Germany, the EU now has 25 countries and a population larger than that of the United States.	我是中文句子
Eight of the new members are former Communist countries that were locked behind the Iron Curtain for nearly half a century.	我是中文句子
Their attraction to the Union is a sign of the appeal - the "soft power" - of the idea of European unification.	我是中文句子
Of course, this new Europe faces many problems.	我是中文句子
The per capita income of the new countries is less than half of that of the fifteen members they are joining. Concerns have been raised about the influx of cheap labor.	我是中文句子
Political arrangements are somewhat more problematic.	我是中文句子
Negotiations are underway to revise a draft EU constitution.	我是中文句子
Some Europeans worry that the constitution will enable courts to carry the integration process further and faster than public opinion in member states will tolerate.	我是中文句子
Lack of grassroots support might lead to rejection of the constitution in countries like Britain, where referenda have been promised before the new arrangements come into force.	我是中文句子
Across the Atlantic, most Americans (to the extent they pay attention) regard these changes with general approval.	我是中文句子
But some express concern that the new Europe will be defined in opposition to the US.	我是中文句子
The recent photographs of detainees being abused and sexually degraded in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison added fuel to the fire.	我是中文句子
Now some American neo-conservatives argue that the US should drop its longstanding support for European integration.	我是中文句子
Such a policy change would be a serious mistake.	我是中文句子
Not only would it add to anti-American attitudes and fail to accomplish its objectives, but it over-estimates the extent to which the new Europe is being formed in opposition to the US.	我是中文句子
Whatever the rhetoric in France, for example, the policies and attitudes in countries such as Britain or Poland demonstrate that good trans-Atlantic relations can be maintained.	我是中文句子
If anything, the risks of a US-Europe split will be reduced rather than increased by the EU's recent enlargement.	我是中文句子
Moreover, there are several objective reasons why the current friction between Europe and the US is unlikely to lead to divorce.	我是中文句子
For one thing, the divisive war in Iraq may turn out to be the last act of the twentieth century rather than a harbinger of the twenty-first.	我是中文句子
Neither side of the Atlantic is immune to the threat, despite the efforts of Osama bin Laden to drive a wedge between Europe and America.	我是中文句子
Transnational terrorism can only be confronted by close civilian cooperation such as intelligence sharing, police work across borders, and tracing financial flows. These forms of cooperation survived the divisions over Iraq.	我是中文句子
Europe and America also share a common structure of economic interests and values.	我是中文句子
While trade produces frictions in democracies, it also enhances wealth.	我是中文句子
If one looks at foreign direct investment, it is clear that the two sides of the Atlantic are closely integrated.	我是中文句子
In terms of values, while some differences exist between Europe and America, at the fundamental level of democracy and human rights, no other two parts of the globe share more.	我是中文句子
In short, it is good for Americans - and for the world - that old and new Europe are becoming one.	我是中文句子
We can all benefit from the soft power of an enlarged Europe.	我是中文句子
America’s Baby Bust	我是中文句子
LONDON – News that the United States’ fertility rate fell in 2017 to 1.75 has provoked surprise and concern.	我是中文句子
But the increasingly strong economic recovery of the last five years has been accompanied by a declining birth rate.	我是中文句子
That seems to presage a long-term shortage of workers relative to retirees, and severe financial pressures on pension funds and health-care provision.	我是中文句子
Moreover, fertility rates at around the current US level do not pose severe problems – and bring some benefits.	我是中文句子
The US rate reached 1.77 in the late 1970s, compared to 1.8 in Northern Europe and 1.65 in Western Europe.	我是中文句子
Canada, with its lower fertility rate, is quite as successful and confident as the US.	我是中文句子
Strong German growth over the last 20 years has been combined with a fertility rate of 1.4-1.5, well below the 1.98 rate in less successful France.	我是中文句子
South Korea has maintained economic expansion with a fertility rate of just 1.2-1.3.	我是中文句子
Latin America’s most prosperous economy, Chile, has a fertility rate of 1.76, well below less successful Argentina’s rate of 2.27.	我是中文句子
The recent decline in US fertility is therefore unsurprising; and, provided it does not fall to much lower levels, there is no cause for concern.	我是中文句子
But as people live longer and healthier lives, retirement ages can and should be increased.	我是中文句子
Notably, fears that robots will take jobs are much less prevalent in Japan and China than in higher-fertility Western countries.	我是中文句子
But degree matters, and extremely low fertility, such as Japan’s rate of 1.4, will create major problems if permanently maintained.	我是中文句子
By contrast, Japan’s population is projected to fall from 125 million today to around 80 million.	我是中文句子
Demographic contraction on that scale will severely stress Japan’s ability to support an aging population.	我是中文句子
The Scandinavian countries are exemplary in this respect, though fertility rates there have not returned to replacement levels, but only to about 1.75-1.9.	我是中文句子
Similar policies in the US might marginally increase the fertility rate from today’s 1.75, with a mildly beneficial net effect.	我是中文句子
But the predominant response to America’s recent fertility decline should be to accept it as inevitable and to stop worrying about it.	我是中文句子
The US Is Exporting Obesity	我是中文句子
And by forcing its food culture on countries like Mexico and Canada, the United States is making the problem worse.	我是中文句子
Of course, the two are not necessarily directly related. A considerable proportion of world hunger occurs in countries suffering from domestic strife or severe government dysfunction.	我是中文句子
The obesity epidemic, however, has a much broader footprint, affecting advanced economies and most emerging markets.	我是中文句子
This same dynamic is playing out worldwide, with obesity rates soaring in Europe, Latin America, and even in China.	我是中文句子
The health costs are staggering, estimated to be close to $200 billion per year in the US alone.	我是中文句子
The causes of obesity are manifold and complex.	我是中文句子
Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence suggests that a culture emphasizing processed food and a generally sedentary lifestyle lies at the center of the problem.	我是中文句子
In emerging markets, rapid urbanization is another important factor, as well as a desire to emulate Western lifestyles.	我是中文句子
Many governments have launched initiatives to improve nutrition education.	我是中文句子
It is hard to ignore the fact that Mexico’s adult obesity rate has soared since the adoption in 1993 of the North American Free Trade Agreement.	我是中文句子
While there are many causes, post-NAFTA direct foreign investment in the processed food industry and a surge in advertising are important contributors.	我是中文句子
It is unfortunate that government regulators have been so slow to try to reverse these trends by, for example, helping to educate the public on the science of nutrition.	我是中文句子
Though there is some truth to this, the fact is that nutrition research has made significant progress in recent decades.	我是中文句子
The government has other tools at its disposal, besides education, for affecting people’s eating habits.	我是中文句子
They can and should place greater restrictions on advertising to children, as the UK, France, and several other countries have done; obesity in early years can lead to lifelong problems.	我是中文句子
Proceeds from the tax could be used to subsidize healthier alternatives.	我是中文句子
It is perhaps fantasy to expect the current US administration to consider any kind of anti-obesity strategy while it is still busy dismantling Obama-era policies.	我是中文句子
“America First” Financial Regulation?	我是中文句子
It would be a stretch to say that Tarullo has been universally popular in the banking community.	我是中文句子
He led the charge in arguing for much higher capital ratios, in the United States and elsewhere.	我是中文句子
He was a tough negotiator, with a well-tuned instinct for spotting special pleading by financial firms.	我是中文句子
But crocodile tears will be shed in Europe to mark his resignation.	我是中文句子
In his absence, these proposals’ fate is uncertain.	我是中文句子
But Tarullo has also been an enthusiastic promoter of international regulatory cooperation, with the frequent flyer miles to prove it.	我是中文句子
For some years, he has chaired the Financial Stability Board’s little-known but important Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation.	我是中文句子
Already, some of those who criticized him most vocally in the past are anxious about his departure.	我是中文句子
Who will succeed him?	我是中文句子
Will that appointee, whom Trump now needs to select, be as committed as Tarullo to an international approach?	我是中文句子
Or will his principal task be to build a regulatory wall, protecting US banks from global rules?	我是中文句子
This is unacceptable.”	我是中文句子
In her reply of February10, Yellen firmly rebutted McHenry’s arguments.	我是中文句子
But that will not be the end of the story.	我是中文句子
The battle lines are now drawn, and McHenry’s letter shows the arguments that will be deployed in Congress by some Republicans close to the president.	我是中文句子
There has always been a strand of thinking in Washington that dislikes foreign entanglements, in this and other areas.	我是中文句子
It is a little hard to see that arrangement working well today.	我是中文句子
These questions are of more than passing interest in Europe.	我是中文句子
European capital adequacy directives typically transpose Basel Accords into EU law.	我是中文句子
If the Basel process stalls, transatlantic deals, which are the crucial underpinning of Western capital markets, will be far harder to reach.	我是中文句子
There is a further complication arising from Brexit.	我是中文句子
No likely Federal Reserve Board candidates have been spotted at poolside, or being interviewed on the golf course, but a decision cannot be far off.	我是中文句子
Nothing can be taken for granted.	我是中文句子
The financial world is holding its collective breath.	我是中文句子
Navigating America’s Economic-Policy Shocks	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – With a series of tax and trade moves being considered in the United States this year, emerging-market economies are likely to face devaluation pressure and volatility.	我是中文句子
Three sources of US-fueled economic uncertainty, in particular, will rattle emerging markets in 2017.	我是中文句子
Both President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled US Congress have said they favor the scheme, which has a fair chance of being enacted.	我是中文句子
The second source of uncertainty is the possibility of more aggressive action on Chinese exports to the US.	我是中文句子
The Trump administration has said many times that it will confront China over what it considers unfair trade practices.	我是中文句子
Trump has openly mused about imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports.	我是中文句子
The introduction of anything close to that would generate downward pressure on the renminbi, given the resulting reduction in demand for Chinese exports.	我是中文句子
But such a move would serve to weaken many other currencies as well.	我是中文句子
A third US move that could unsettle emerging markets is faster-than-expected monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.	我是中文句子
A large interest-rate hike would translate into US dollar appreciation, and depreciation of developing-economy currencies.	我是中文句子
One exception may be the currencies of commodity exporters.	我是中文句子
Higher commodity prices, triggered in part by anticipation of increased demand as a result of a boost in US infrastructure spending, could cause these countries’ currencies to strengthen.	我是中文句子
The challenges that US policy changes pose for emerging-market currencies include not only downward pressure, but also greater volatility.	我是中文句子
What, then, should emerging-market countries do to enhance their resilience in anticipation of the shockwaves?	我是中文句子
One option is to optimize the structure of capital inflows.	我是中文句子
A second is to boost the flexibility of exchange rates.	我是中文句子
As for the second option, allowing nominal exchange-rate flexibility would enable currency values to align with underlying economic fundamentals more quickly.	我是中文句子
Such adjustment is especially important for countries with rigid labor markets.	我是中文句子
One danger of fixed exchange rates is the risk of an overvalued or undervalued currency, neither of which is good for economic stability.	我是中文句子
The chance of either scenario is elevated when the forces influencing the equilibrium exchange rate become more volatile.	我是中文句子
While the shape and timing of future US policies are uncertain, it seems clear that capital-flow management and nominal exchange-rate flexibility amount to good preparation.	我是中文句子
To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, if developing countries fail to prepare, they will have to prepare to fail.	我是中文句子
Why Millennials Will Reject Trump	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The key political divide in the United States is not between parties or states; it is between generations.	我是中文句子
The millennial generation (those aged 18-35) voted heavily against Donald Trump and will form the backbone of resistance to his policies.	我是中文句子
Older Americans are divided, but Trump’s base lies among those above the age of 45.	我是中文句子
On issue after issue, younger voters will reject Trump, viewing him as a politician of the past, not the future.	我是中文句子
Of course, these are averages, not absolutes.	我是中文句子
Yet the numbers confirm the generational divide.	我是中文句子
The point is not that today’s young liberals will become tomorrow’s older conservatives.	我是中文句子
The millennial generation is far more liberal than the baby boomers and silent generation were in their younger years.	我是中文句子
They are also decidedly less partisan, and will support politicians who address their values and needs, including third-party aspirants.	我是中文句子
There are at least three big differences in the politics of the young and old.	我是中文句子
First, the young are more socially liberal than the older generations.	我是中文句子
For them, America’s growing racial, religious, and sexual plurality is no big deal.	我是中文句子
Second, the young are facing the unprecedented economic challenges of the information revolution.	我是中文句子
The elderly rich, by contrast, are enjoying a stock market boom caused by the same technological revolution.	我是中文句子
Third, compared to their parents and grandparents, the young are much more aware of climate change and its threats.	我是中文句子
While Trump is enticing the older generation with one last fling with fossil fuels, the young will have none of it.	我是中文句子
They want clean energy and will fight against the destruction of the Earth that they and their own children will inherit.	我是中文句子
Older Americans didn’t learn about climate change in school.	我是中文句子
They were never introduced to the basic science of greenhouse gases.	我是中文句子
That is why they are ready to put their own short-term financial interests ahead of the dire threats to their grandchildren’s generation.	我是中文句子
Trump’s economic policies are geared to this older, whiter, native-born America.	我是中文句子
He favors tax cuts for the older rich, which would burden the young with higher debt.	我是中文句子
He is indifferent to the $1 trillion overhang of student debt.	我是中文句子
And he is obsessed with squeezing a few more years of profit out of America’s coal, oil, and gas reserves at the cost of a future environmental catastrophe.	我是中文句子
One might attribute Trump’s backward-looking mindset to his age.	我是中文句子
At 70, Trump is the oldest person ever to become president (Ronald Reagan was slightly younger when he took office in 1981).	我是中文句子
Yet age is hardly the sole or even the main factor here.	我是中文句子
The main issue here is mindset and political orientation, not chronological age.	我是中文句子
Trump has the shortest time horizon (and attention span) of any president in historical memory.	我是中文句子
And he is utterly out of touch with the real challenges facing the young generation as they grapple with new technologies, shifting labor markets, and crushing student debt.	我是中文句子
A trade war with Mexico and China, or a tragically misconceived ban on Muslim migrants, will hardly meet their real needs.	我是中文句子
Trump’s political success is a blip, not a turning point.	我是中文句子
Today’s millennials, with their future-oriented perspective, will soon dominate American politics.	我是中文句子
America will be multiethnic, socially liberal, climate conscious, and much fairer in sharing the economic benefits of new technology.	我是中文句子
Their time is coming, most likely with a president they support in 2020.	我是中文句子
What Makes America Great	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – Presidential inaugurations and commencement ceremonies are usually very emotional events.	我是中文句子
They are rites of passage that mark both an end and a new beginning in the life of a country or an individual.	我是中文句子
As a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, I attend our commencement ceremony every year.	我是中文句子
One of the highlights of our ceremony is a video in which several professors and public personalities read, line by line, John F. Kennedy’s inaugural address.	我是中文句子
To understand why, it is useful to recall a few of the most famous passages.	我是中文句子
If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.”	我是中文句子
My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.”	我是中文句子
Fast forward to today.	我是中文句子
President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign narrative was based on the assumption that the US has fallen from its former greatness.	我是中文句子
Jobs have moved to Mexico and China because weak leaders negotiated bad deals.	我是中文句子
Immigrants, mostly illegal, have taken the few jobs that remain, killing and raping in their free time.	我是中文句子
Such a speech will encourage no one to “bear any burden” for the sake of any universal principle or challenge, be it human rights or global warming.	我是中文句子
It will not exhort us to focus on something bigger than ourselves.	我是中文句子
For the US, it was “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”	我是中文句子
For the Soviet Union, it was international proletarian solidarity – “workers of the world, unite.”	我是中文句子
Such an America will find its ability to lead the world compromised by a shortage of goodwill and an abundance of distrust.	我是中文句子
Other countries will huddle together to protect themselves from the US bully.	我是中文句子
If Trump really wants to make America great again, he should ponder how his inaugural address will sound to a global audience 56 years from now.	我是中文句子
Will it inspire the Class of 2073 the way Kennedy’s address still inspires graduates today?	我是中文句子
America Goes from Teacher to Student	我是中文句子
The silver lining is that there are many highly distinguished current and former policymakers out there, particularly from emerging market countries, who have seen this movie before.	我是中文句子
If US policymakers would only listen, they might get an idea or two about how to deal with financial crises from experts who have lived through them and come out safely on the other side.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, the parallel between today’s US crisis and previous financial crises is not mere hyperbole.	我是中文句子
But there are strong quantitative parallels as well.	我是中文句子
The US should do the same.	我是中文句子
Admittedly, the IMF’s panel would have to look past America’s current hypocrisy.	我是中文句子
The US Treasury strongly encouraged Asia to tighten fiscal policy during its 1990’s crisis.	我是中文句子
For years, foreign governments complained about American hedge funds, arguing that their non-transparent behavior posed unacceptable risks to stability.	我是中文句子
In fact, having countries like Russia and China more vested in the well-being of the US economy would not be a bad thing.	我是中文句子
For years, I, along with many others, have complained that emerging markets need greater representation in global financial governance.	我是中文句子
Today, the issue goes far beyond symbolism.	我是中文句子
The US economy is in trouble, and the problems it spins off are unlikely to stop at the US border.	我是中文句子
Experts from emerging markets and elsewhere have much to say about dealing with financial crises.	我是中文句子
America should start to listen before it is too late.	我是中文句子
Obamacare and Effective Government	我是中文句子
Innovation is probably the least discussed aspect of health-care reform.	我是中文句子
Yet it is crucial to “bending” the sector’s cost curve, because it enables the delivery of quality health care in cost-effective ways.	我是中文句子
Obamacare has provided powerful new incentives for such innovation.	我是中文句子
Such patients are among the 10% who account for an estimated 64% of overall health care costs.	我是中文句子
Around the US, providers, insurers, non-profits, and local governments are responding to the ACA’s incentives.	我是中文句子
Of course, it is still too early to declare victory, but Obamacare seems to be working.	我是中文句子
But the real surprise is that growth in health-care spending slowed dramatically from 2010 to 2013, to roughly the same pace as GDP growth.	我是中文句子
This represented a sharp break from the previous half-century; indeed, this period was characterized by the slowest growth in real per capita health-care spending on record.	我是中文句子
To be sure, the ACA is only one factor in this promising trend; growth in health-care spending often slows in the wake of an economic downturn.	我是中文句子
But Medicare spending, which is not affected by recessions, has slowed along with private health-care spending.	我是中文句子
In a recent study, the CEA concluded that the ACA’s Medicare reforms account for a significant share of the slowdown.	我是中文句子
The government plays a role akin to that of a venture capitalist providing seed money and financial support to foster innovation.	我是中文句子
Brenner mapped “hot spots” around Camden, and sought to find out why people in some areas ran up such huge bills.	我是中文句子
The problem was not fraud. It was an absence of coordinated medical care, especially basic primary care, and a lack of attention to people’s underlying risk factors.	我是中文句子
The most expensive 1% of patients, those with a tangle of issues, accounted for 30% of Camden’s public health-care spending.	我是中文句子
Oregon has entered into a pay-for-success bargain with the federal government.	我是中文句子
The state will receive $1.9 billion over five years to revamp its Medicaid services along the lines of Camden’s approach.	我是中文句子
Oregon will get the money only if its per-person Medicaid costs climb substantially more slowly than other states’.	我是中文句子
At the moment, Oregon is on track.	我是中文句子
The results so far are promising – not just by reining in costs, but also by better aligning service delivery with best practices.	我是中文句子
The government can spur innovation by offering incentives that tap many different players’ strengths.	我是中文句子
And health-care reform is just one example in which government can deliver what the public wants by setting goals, encouraging creativity, and providing the resources to scale up what works.	我是中文句子
America’s Hidden Debt	我是中文句子
Unless the mix of spending changes, the debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to grow, foretelling disaster.	我是中文句子
Others do not share such concerns.	我是中文句子
But while judgments differ about the sustainability of US government debt, they both accept the standard measure of it as accurate.	我是中文句子
This is a mistake, and possibly a catastrophic one.	我是中文句子
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently reported that the federal budget deficit in the first ten months of this fiscal year was $116 billion higher than it was at the same time last year.	我是中文句子
The CBO is now projecting that the annual deficit will reach $1 trillion by 2020.	我是中文句子
This is worrying, but it does not reflect the harsh truth. The annual deficit almost certainly surpassed $1 trillion last year.	我是中文句子
To understand why, think of America as a home with a leaky roof.	我是中文句子
In this scenario, your maintenance delays cannot be ignored.	我是中文句子
The law requires that you disclose and pay for the hidden costs of repairing the roof. Otherwise, you are stealing from the buyer.	我是中文句子
True, unlike the mortgage on your balance sheet, you may not regard roof maintenance as a current liability.	我是中文句子
But putting it off doesn’t make it disappear.	我是中文句子
It is still a real debt – just one that has gone unaccounted for.	我是中文句子
The federal government also has debt that has not been accounted for, and which one doesn’t often hear about.	我是中文句子
And these are just two broad examples.	我是中文句子
So, just how much hidden US debt is there?	我是中文句子
At this point, we must rely on rough estimates.	我是中文句子
All told, that is $11.8 trillion in unaccounted-for non-inflation-adjusted liabilities.	我是中文句子
To be sure, these debts are not solely federal liabilities.	我是中文句子
In the past, state and local governments were responsible for most infrastructure and climate costs.	我是中文句子
They are America’s national “leaky roof.”	我是中文句子
And between 2012 and 2014, the IEA increased its estimated cost of moving to a clean-energy system by roughly $270 billion per year.	我是中文句子
The 2017 US federal deficit was $665 billion, reflecting the amount by which debt that is actually accounted for increased.	我是中文句子
If infrastructure and climate debt that is not accounted for were to be included, the all-in deficit in 2017 would have been over $1 trillion.	我是中文句子
Yes, these are back-of-the-envelope calculations, but they point to an urgent question: Why isn’t the US counting its hidden debts?	我是中文句子
The short answer is that the law doesn’t require it.	我是中文句子
Until all debt is counted, we cannot even begin to know whether fiscal policies are having positive or negative effects on future growth.	我是中文句子
America’s Second Chance with India	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington, DC, in June garnered little public attention outside of India.	我是中文句子
Yet diplomats and military professionals in Asia and beyond were certainly watching closely.	我是中文句子
For good reason: the rapprochement between the world’s two most populous democracies could shape the world’s future.	我是中文句子
It is worth noting that in his address to the US Congress, Modi invoked the word “partner” or “partnership” no fewer than 15 times.	我是中文句子
The official joint statement released by the two governments described India as a “Major Defense Partner” of the United States, eligible for advanced technologies with military applications.	我是中文句子
The relationship between India and the US has evolved from one of cool distance to strategic proximity in a generation – lightning fast for geopolitics.	我是中文句子
The factors underlying this shift merit attention, for many of them are likely to bring the two countries even closer.	我是中文句子
The Cold War’s end was a significant part of the bilateral rapprochement, because it eliminated the possibility of India’s continued association with the Soviet Union, as well as its rationale for embracing non-alignment.	我是中文句子
A second factor is Pakistan.	我是中文句子
For a long time, the US pursued an even-handed policy toward South Asia’s two most strategically important countries.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, during most of the Cold War, Pakistan was seen as a friendly country, whereas its great rival, India, was viewed as difficult.	我是中文句子
This view was reinforced when Pakistan became the essential conduit of weapons to Afghans fighting the Soviet occupation of their country.	我是中文句子
But the bond between the US and Pakistan weakened when Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989.	我是中文句子
As a result, US ties to India were no longer constrained by fear of complications in Pakistan.	我是中文句子
China is also animating the improvement in India-US ties.	我是中文句子
The motivation is far more fundamental than the fact that India and China still have an unresolved border.	我是中文句子
Domestic politics also loom large in the relationship’s development – on both sides.	我是中文句子
The decline of India’s Congress party reduced the influence of the political force most associated with maintaining distance from the US.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, there are now more than three million Indian-Americans, and, as with many other immigrant populations, they have become ever more prominent and powerful.	我是中文句子
Economic ties are also growing, along with India’s economy.	我是中文句子
Bilateral trade has increased to more than $100 billion a year.	我是中文句子
High-level visits have become commonplace.	我是中文句子
Closer economic ties and large-scale collaboration on clean energy are a high priority.	我是中文句子
One can also predict increased cooperation between the two countries’ military and intelligence establishments.	我是中文句子
Indeed, joint efforts to keep the Indian Ocean open and safe are already a reality.	我是中文句子
The US and India need not be formal allies for their relationship to have the desired effect on Chinese strategic calculations.	我是中文句子
Challenges remain, of course.	我是中文句子
Bureaucracy, corruption, and poor infrastructure continue to hold back India’s economy.	我是中文句子
Indian leaders must also be careful not to do or say things that could alienate the country’s large Muslim minority.	我是中文句子
And they must still ensure that close ties with the US are not simply the policy of one prime minister or party.	我是中文句子
This means getting the Congress party fully on board and overcoming the resistance of career officials to new ways of thinking and acting.	我是中文句子
It is difficult to overlook the irony in much of this.	我是中文句子
More than a half-century ago, in the early years of the Cold War, many in Washington saw India as a potential model of non-Communist political and economic development.	我是中文句子
Now, however, India is emerging as a successful example of a market-oriented democracy with close ties to the US.	我是中文句子
Second chances are rare in life, but both India and the US may be getting just that.	我是中文句子
America Keeping Haiti Down	我是中文句子
Its actions in Haiti, however, have severely undermined those goals.	我是中文句子
These actions violated the IDB’s own charter, which strictly prohibits the Bank and its members from interfering in the internal political affairs of member states.	我是中文句子
Indeed, by requesting further review of the loans, Haiti would have to make scheduled payments before the funds were even disbursed.	我是中文句子
These tactics worked.	我是中文句子
The results have been devastating.	我是中文句子
Researchers found three-quarters of water sources in the city contained high levels of coliform bacteria, a key indicator of contamination with fecal matter.	我是中文句子
A frightening 15% of households reported symptoms likely related to typhoid.	我是中文句子
The Myth of Sound Fundamentals	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – The spin is all too predictable.	我是中文句子
With the US stock market clawing its way back from the sharp correction of early February, the mindless mantra of the great bull market has returned.	我是中文句子
The recent correction is now being characterized as a fleeting aberration – a volatility shock – in what is still deemed to be a very accommodating investment climate.	我是中文句子
After all, the argument goes, economic fundamentals – not just in the United States, but worldwide – haven’t been this good in a long, long time.	我是中文句子
But are the fundamentals really that sound?	我是中文句子
For a US economy that has a razor-thin cushion of saving, nothing could be further from the truth.	我是中文句子
Net saving represents today’s investment in the future, and the bottom line for America is that it is saving next to nothing.	我是中文句子
Alas, the story doesn’t end there.	我是中文句子
To finance consumption and growth, the US borrows surplus saving from abroad to compensate for the domestic shortfall.	我是中文句子
All that borrowing implies a large balance-of-payments deficit with the rest of the world, which spawns an equally large trade deficit.	我是中文句子
While President Donald Trump’s administration is hardly responsible for this sad state of affairs, its policies are about to make a tough situation far worse.	我是中文句子
Under the guise of tax reform, late last year Trump signed legislation that will increase the federal budget deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.	我是中文句子
With these deficits, of course, come equally chronic trade deficits with a broad cross-section of America’s foreign partners.	我是中文句子
Astonishingly, in 2017, the US ran trade deficits with 102 countries.	我是中文句子
Far from sound, the fundamentals of a saving-short US economy look shakier than ever.	我是中文句子
Lacking a cushion of solid support from income generation, the lack of saving also leaves the US far more beholden to fickle asset markets than might otherwise be the case.	我是中文句子
That’s especially true of American consumers who have relied on appreciation of equity holdings and home values to support over-extended lifestyles.	我是中文句子
It is also the case for the US Federal Reserve, which has turned to unconventional monetary policies to support the real economy via so-called wealth effects.	我是中文句子
But momentum and fundamentals are two very different things.	我是中文句子
Momentum can be fleeting, especially for a saving-short US economy that is consuming the seed corn of future prosperity.	我是中文句子
With dysfunctional policies pointing to a further compression of saving in the years ahead, the myth of sound US fundamentals has never rung more hollow.	我是中文句子
America’s Midterm Elections Turn Menacing	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – With the approach of this year’s midterm elections in the United States, domestic terrorism is starting to dominate the political landscape.	我是中文句子
(None of the bombs exploded.)	我是中文句子
Then things became much worse, with the murder, on a Saturday, of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue.	我是中文句子
The most disheartening aspect of the entire episode was Trump’s utter incapacity as a national leader.	我是中文句子
But that should surprise no one.	我是中文句子
It didn’t last.	我是中文句子
And soon he was back to whipping up fear of a caravan of refugees from Honduras.	我是中文句子
Trump’s rallies are now almost a daily event, and his lies are even more frequent than before.	我是中文句子
The midterm election following the election of a new president is often considered a verdict on the incumbent, and his party usually loses strength, particularly in the House.	我是中文句子
But Trump has made the midterms about himself to an unprecedented degree.	我是中文句子
Trump’s determination, or anxiety, that Republicans maintain control of both chambers is understandable.	我是中文句子
At least the House is likely to have the conclusions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to consider.	我是中文句子
In other words, no more lapdog Congress.	我是中文句子
But if the Republicans maintain control of the Senate, there will be limits on what the Democrats can achieve.	我是中文句子
Whether a Democratic House would even proceed in that direction has been the subject of intra-party debate.	我是中文句子
The nightmare election possibility for the Democrats is continued Republican control of both chambers.	我是中文句子
In that case, Trump will feel vindicated and more liberated than ever.	我是中文句子
The conventional wisdom may prevail, with the Democrats winning the House but not the Senate.	我是中文句子
But the polls have been fluctuating.	我是中文句子
And since Trump’s stunning election victory in 2016, most observers have become more cautious about predicting outcomes.	我是中文句子
Alliances for Peace	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – I grew up in the shadow of World War II, and at the dawn of the Cold War.	我是中文句子
What strikes me now, all these years later, is that a generation of leaders won not only a war, but also the peace.	我是中文句子
They did it together.	我是中文句子
The United States and our partners worked to create alliances that brought prosperity and stability to Western Europe, Japan, and South Korea.	我是中文句子
Old enemies became new allies, and together pioneered a new global economic system that made the world more prosperous.	我是中文句子
And even as the Cold War raged, leaders found ways to cooperate on arms control and prevent a nuclear Armageddon.	我是中文句子
That is the remarkable story of the twentieth century.	我是中文句子
The question now is what story will emerge from the twenty-first century.	我是中文句子
Today, the world order faces new challenges.	我是中文句子
Russian aggression is rattling allies.	我是中文句子
Extremists who hijack religion threaten governments and people everywhere.	我是中文句子
Technology is accelerating a shift in the balance of power between governments and governed that offers both opportunities for democratic accountability and obstacles to inclusive politics.	我是中文句子
We have gone from a world where power resided in hierarchies to one where it inhabits networks.	我是中文句子
Statecraft has yet to adapt.	我是中文句子
The international institutions and partnerships that emerged in the postwar years demand both maintenance and modernization.	我是中文句子
In the face of all of this turbulence, some suggest that America should turn inward.	我是中文句子
That is nothing new.	我是中文句子
Some argued the same after WWII.	我是中文句子
They argued it again 25 years ago, after the fall of the Berlin Wall.	我是中文句子
They were wrong then – and they are wrong now.	我是中文句子
The need for leadership has never been greater, and the US has never been more engaged with the world.	我是中文句子
The world has changed, and we are changing with it.	我是中文句子
Lines on the map no longer contain the gravest threats, and the players are no longer divided neatly into two camps.	我是中文句子
In the twenty-first century, next door is everywhere.	我是中文句子
That is why the world needs coalition diplomacy.	我是中文句子
No country can defeat terrorism on its own.	我是中文句子
No country can solve the existential threat of climate change alone.	我是中文句子
No country can eradicate extreme poverty, combat potential pandemics, or improve nuclear security by itself.	我是中文句子
None of us can live safer, richer lives by turning our back to the world.	我是中文句子
A good example is the international effort to confront the Islamic State’s malign brutality in Iraq and Syria.	我是中文句子
Political, humanitarian, and intelligence tools from more than 60 countries are being used to support unified military action.	我是中文句子
On an equally important front, the US is working with the United Nations to galvanize a global response to the danger posed by the Ebola virus.	我是中文句子
We are making progress on both issues, but much work remains.	我是中文句子
Bringing together countries with competing interests and varying resources is hard work.	我是中文句子
It demands intense diplomatic engagement and calls upon relationships that have been built and maintained over decades, as well as alliances with new partners.	我是中文句子
Cooperation is equally vital in reinforcing the bedrock economic principles on which America and other countries built their postwar prosperity.	我是中文句子
Frustration cannot grow faster than opportunity in any country.	我是中文句子
The benefits – for both the US and our partners – are enormous.	我是中文句子
Estimates are that the TPP could provide $77 billion a year in real income and support 650,000 new jobs in the US alone.	我是中文句子
Whether for mutual security or shared prosperity, genuine partnerships are not built overnight.	我是中文句子
Closing the Investment Gap	我是中文句子
Indeed, according to the International Monetary Fund, through 2014, private investment declined by an average of 25% compared to pre-crisis trends.	我是中文句子
The shortfall in investment has been deep and broad-based, affecting not only residential investment but also investment in equipment and structures.	我是中文句子
Interestingly, the investment shortfall in the US coincides with a strong rebound in returns to capital.	我是中文句子
By one measure, returns to private capital are now at a higher point than any time in recent decades.	我是中文句子
According to the IMF, this “accelerator” theory of investment explains most of the weakness of business investment in the developed economies since the 2008 crisis.	我是中文句子
In accordance with this explanation, investment growth in the US has been in line with its usual historical relationship with output growth.	我是中文句子
In short, private investment growth has been weak primarily because the pace of recovery has been anemic.	我是中文句子
Businesses have marked down their pre-crisis investment plans to reflect a post-crisis “new normal” of slower and more uncertain growth in demand for their output.	我是中文句子
Under conditions of weak aggregate demand, stronger public investment encourages more private business investment.	我是中文句子
But public investment, too, has fallen below pre-crisis expectations, aggravating rather than ameliorating the slump in private investment.	我是中文句子
Indeed, telecom and cable companies accounted for the largest share of business capital expenditures during the last three years, with energy production and mining second on the list.	我是中文句子
Differences in innovation opportunities across industries are also consistent with the changing composition of business investment.	我是中文句子
R&D investment usually expands faster than GDP during cyclical expansions, and the current period is in line with historical trends.	我是中文句子
Indeed, as a share of the economy, R&D investment is now at its highest level on record, which bodes well for future productivity growth.	我是中文句子
As the accelerator theory of investment would predict, much R&D investment is occurring in technology-intensive sectors where current and future expected demand has been strong.	我是中文句子
There is also evidence that the distribution of returns to capital is becoming increasingly skewed toward these sectors.	我是中文句子
After a sharp downturn during the 2008-2009 recession, this proportion has now recovered to nearly 50%, a high point relative to historical averages.	我是中文句子
Indeed, some 79% reported pressure to demonstrate strong financial returns in two years or less.	我是中文句子
Shareholder pressure tends to be greater in older firms, and in the US over the last few decades, the proportion of older firms has been growing as the startup rate for new businesses has fallen.	我是中文句子
A sliding capital gains tax, with rates that decline as the holding period for investments increases, would reduce incentives for short-termism among investors.	我是中文句子
These frameworks, Fink notes, should cover environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors that are core determinants of long-term value.	我是中文句子
Strategic frameworks, along with ESG disclosure, should encourage both companies and their shareholders to focus more on long-term value and less on short-term financial performance.	我是中文句子
But at the macro level, expected growth in demand and associated innovation opportunities will remain the primary drivers of business investment.	我是中文句子
Inequality and the American Child	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Children, it has long been recognized, are a special group.	我是中文句子
They do not choose their parents, let alone the broader conditions into which they are born.	我是中文句子
They do not have the same abilities as adults to protect or care for themselves.	我是中文句子
That is why the League of Nations approved the Geneva Declaration on the Rights of the Child in 1924, and why the international community adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989.	我是中文句子
Sadly, the United States is not living up to its obligations.	我是中文句子
In fact, it has not even ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.	我是中文句子
The US, with its cherished image as a land of opportunity, should be an inspiring example of just and enlightened treatment of children.	我是中文句子
Instead, it is a beacon of failure – one that contributes to global sluggishness on children’s rights in the international arena.	我是中文句子
Though an average American childhood may not be the worst in the world, the disparity between the country’s wealth and the condition of its children is unparalleled.	我是中文句子
Among developed countries, only Romania has a higher rate of child poverty.	我是中文句子
The US rate is two-thirds higher than that in the United Kingdom, and up to four times the rate in the Nordic countries.	我是中文句子
For some groups, the situation is much worse: more than 38% of black children, and 30% of Hispanic children, are poor.	我是中文句子
None of this is because Americans do not care about their children.	我是中文句子
It is because America has embraced a policy agenda in recent decades that has caused its economy to become wildly unequal, leaving the most vulnerable segments of society further and further behind.	我是中文句子
As a result, America’s children have become worse off.	我是中文句子
Indeed, nearly one in five poor American children are diagnosed with asthma, a rate 60% higher than non-poor children.	我是中文句子
These inequalities in outcomes are closely tied to inequalities in opportunities.	我是中文句子
At America’s most elite universities, for example, only around 9% of students come from the bottom half of the population, while 74% come from the top quarter.	我是中文句子
Most societies recognize a moral obligation to help ensure that young people can live up to their potential.	我是中文句子
Some countries even impose a constitutional mandate for equality of educational opportunities.	我是中文句子
But in America, more is spent on the education of rich students than on the education of the poor.	我是中文句子
As a result, the US is wasting some of its most valuable assets, with some young people – bereft of skills – turning to dysfunctional activities.	我是中文句子
American states like California spend about as much on prisons as on higher education – and sometimes more.	我是中文句子
That should be a spur to policy action.	我是中文句子
Indeed, while inequality’s harmful effects are wide-reaching, and impose huge costs on our economies and societies, they are largely avoidable.	我是中文句子
The extremes of inequality observed in some countries are not the inexorable result of economic forces and laws.	我是中文句子
So why don’t we?	我是中文句子
Of the harm that inequality inflicts on our economies, politics, and societies, the damage done to children demands special concern.	我是中文句子
Children, perhaps more than anyone, need the protection that rights afford – and the US should be providing the world with a shining example of what that means.	我是中文句子
American Conservatism’s Crisis of Ideas	我是中文句子
But let’s back up historically, to the founding of what we might call modern conservatism in early nineteenth-century Britain and France.	我是中文句子
The main thrust of early conservatism was root-and-branch opposition to every form of social insurance: make the poor richer, and they would become more fertile.	我是中文句子
As a result, farm sizes would drop (as land was divided among ever more children), labor productivity would fall, and the poor would become even poorer.	我是中文句子
Social insurance was not just pointless; it was counterproductive.	我是中文句子
Then, perhaps, with women chaste for half or more of their childbearing years, the surplus population would diminish and conditions for the poor would be as good as they could be.	我是中文句子
The government, Milton Friedman and others argued, told the poor: make more money and we will take away your free housing, food stamps, and income support.	我是中文句子
People are rational, Friedman said, so they will not work for long if they get nothing or next to nothing for it.	我是中文句子
So what is the problem that America’s new generation of conservative critics of social insurance sees?	我是中文句子
For Eberstadt, the problem is that dependence on government is emasculating, and that too many people are dependent on government.	我是中文句子
For Brooks, it is that knowing that public programs make one’s life easier causes one to vote for non-Republican candidates.	我是中文句子
The crucial point is that America’s conservative elites believe Brooks, Eberstadt, and Murray.	我是中文句子
He could “never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”	我是中文句子
The problem for American conservatives is not their choice of candidates or the tone of their rhetoric. It is that their ideas are not politically sustainable.	我是中文句子
An Unhinged Democracy in America	我是中文句子
But de Tocqueville had serious reservations, too.	我是中文句子
He was convinced that any exercise of unlimited power, be it by an individual despot or a political majority, is bound to end in disaster.	我是中文句子
Democracy, in the sense of majority rule, needs restraints, just like any other system of government.	我是中文句子
That is why the British have mixed the authority of elected politicians with that of aristocratic privilege.	我是中文句子
And it is why Americans still cherish their Constitution’s separation of governmental powers.	我是中文句子
By contrast, in the French republican system, the state represents the so-called will of the people.	我是中文句子
As a result, its authority is less constrained, which may explain the greater frequency in France of street demonstrations and even of mob violence.	我是中文句子
Indeed, these upheavals may act as informal checks on official power.	我是中文句子
De Tocqueville identified another source of restraint in the US system: the power of religion.	我是中文句子
Human greed, as well as the temptation of going to extremes, was tempered by the moderating influence of a shared Christian faith.	我是中文句子
Liberty, in the US, was inextricably entwined with religious belief.	我是中文句子
The spectacle of American politics today would seem to cast doubt on de Tocqueville’s observation.	我是中文句子
Or, rather, the rhetoric of many Republicans aspiring to be President sounds like a perversion of what he saw in 1831.	我是中文句子
Religion and liberty are still mentioned in one breath, but often to promote extreme views.	我是中文句子
Religious minorities are denounced.	我是中文句子
Apocalyptic fears are stoked.	我是中文句子
Intolerance is promoted.	我是中文句子
All in the name of God.	我是中文句子
Of course, the US is not the only country where fringe demagogues are now poisoning mainstream politics.	我是中文句子
Religious language is less often heard in Western Europe, but all the more in parts of Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Israel.	我是中文句子
Populism is causing considerable alarm, not least because mainstream politicians seem less and less capable of finding a convincing way to stop its rise.	我是中文句子
Those who are rightly worried about the politics of fear like to assume that populism is a threat to democracy itself.	我是中文句子
Distrust of the elites fosters distrust of the system, and the longing for great leaders who will deliver us from the selfishness of professional politicians will lead to new forms of tyranny.	我是中文句子
That may turn out to be true.	我是中文句子
But, in fact, it is not really democracy that is presently under siege.	我是中文句子
In some ways, many societies are more democratic than they were before.	我是中文句子
If nothing else, the Donald Trump phenomenon shows that old party establishments can be skirted by popular outsiders.	我是中文句子
Social media also make it possible to bypass the traditional filters of authority, such as serious newspapers or broadcasters, and publish any point of view directly.	我是中文句子
The power of private fortunes to sway public opinion, especially in the US, also upsets the traditional order.	我是中文句子
Anti-elitism can be fanned by vast individual wealth, because elitism is defined less by financial clout than by education.	我是中文句子
Angry people swayed by the populist message are angrier at liberal professors, clever bankers, or skeptical journalists than they are at multi-billionaires.	我是中文句子
At the same time, people have more power to elect power-hungry crooks than they did before.	我是中文句子
Like the wild and woolly views swirling around the Internet, such figures are no longer kept at bay by traditional party elites.	我是中文句子
What is steadily falling away is not democracy, but the restraints that de Tocqueville thought were essential to make liberal politics work.	我是中文句子
More and more, populist leaders regard their election by the majority of voters as a license to crush all political and cultural dissent.	我是中文句子
It is hard to see how traditional elites are going to regain any authority.	我是中文句子
And yet I think de Tocqueville was right.	我是中文句子
Without editors, there can be no serious journalism.	我是中文句子
Without parties led by experienced politicians, the borders between show business and politics will disappear.	我是中文句子
Without limits placed on the appetites and prejudices of the majority, intolerance will rule.	我是中文句子
This is not a question of nostalgia or snobbery.	我是中文句子
Nor is it a plea to trust anyone with a plausible air of authority.	我是中文句子
Anger at the elites is not always unjust.	我是中文句子
Globalization, immigration, and cosmopolitanism have served the interests of a highly educated minority, but sometimes at the expense of less privileged people.	我是中文句子
And yet, the problem identified by de Tocqueville in the 1830s is more relevant now than ever.	我是中文句子
Liberal democracy cannot be reduced to a popularity contest.	我是中文句子
Constraints on majority rule are necessary to protect the rights of minorities, be they ethnic, religious, or intellectual.	我是中文句子
When that protection disappears, we will all end up losing the freedoms that democracy was supposed to defend.	我是中文句子
The Indispensable American Partner	我是中文句子
MADRID – The United States is gearing up for that most intoxicating (and exhausting) of political events: an open-seat race for the presidency.	我是中文句子
With US President Barack Obama's eight years in office coming to an end, and Vice President Joe Biden unlikely to run, the race will be without an incumbent.	我是中文句子
As a result, the election could be less a referendum on the last eight years than a contest of ideas, with foreign policy emerging as a key topic.	我是中文句子
This is not merely a matter of semantics; such a change will require the US to re-conceive its role in the world.	我是中文句子
But the payoff, for both the US and the liberal world order that it created, would be substantial.	我是中文句子
The key to success will be America's ability to retain the best – and abandon the worst – of that most American of notions: exceptionalism.	我是中文句子
In doing so, he planted the seed of the values-based approach that was adopted by the US as it spearheaded the development of the rules and structures that order today's world.	我是中文句子
Those rules and structures have delivered unprecedented economic growth, benefiting all (though the US has reaped the greatest rewards).	我是中文句子
But, ironically, the notion of American exceptionalism often has led the US to undermine the international system that it nurtured.	我是中文句子
Indeed, US history reveals a persistent isolationist streak, in which the “city upon a hill" is not a beacon, but a fortress.	我是中文句子
At times, including over the last six years, the belief that the US is better off going it alone has led to withdrawal from the world.	我是中文句子
This tendency was not a serious issue before World War II (though the people of Abyssinia and Manchuria may beg to differ).	我是中文句子
Yet isolationism is not America's most destructive impulse.	我是中文句子
How can the US expect China to follow rules on maritime delimitation in the East and South China Seas when it refuses to ratify the United Nations	我是中文句子
But, though such arrangements make for great headlines, they do not provide the stability and predictability necessary for long-term success.	我是中文句子
For that,	我是中文句子
It should begin by strengthening the flagging institutions that have served as the backbone of the liberal international order.	我是中文句子
Indispensable partnership is about helping countries help themselves.	我是中文句子
It requires vision, commitment, and, most important, leadership.	我是中文句子
A frank discussion about America's foreign policy could prove vital to ensuring that this “city upon a hill" remains a beacon of hope – and a catalyst of progress.	我是中文句子
American Foreign Policy after Iraq	我是中文句子
What comes after Iraq?	我是中文句子
Will it turn inward, as it did after its defeat in Vietnam three decades ago?	我是中文句子
Will it turn from promoting democracy to a narrow realist view of its interests?	我是中文句子
Even while discussion in Washington is fixated on Iraq, a number of thoughtful foreign observers are asking these longer-term questions.	我是中文句子
Analysts and pundits have often been mistaken about America’s position in the world.	我是中文句子
For example, two decades ago, the conventional wisdom was that the US was in decline.	我是中文句子
A decade later, with the Cold War’s end, the new conventional wisdom was that the world was a unipolar American hegemony.	我是中文句子
Some neo-conservative pundits drew the conclusion that the US was so powerful that it could decide what it thought was right, and others would have to follow.	我是中文句子
But the new unilateralism was based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of power in world politics.	我是中文句子
Power is the ability to get the outcomes one wants.	我是中文句子
Whether the possession of resources will produce such outcomes depends upon the context.	我是中文句子
In the past, it was assumed that military power dominated most issues, but in today’s world, the contexts of power differ greatly.	我是中文句子
I have likened the distribution of power in politics today as analogous to a three-dimensional chess game.	我是中文句子
On the top board – military relations among states – the world is, indeed, unipolar, and likely to remain that way for decades.	我是中文句子
Yet it is on this bottom board that we find most of the greatest challenges we face today.	我是中文句子
The new unilateralists who dominated Bush’s first administration made the mistake of thinking that the unipolar distribution of power in the military context was sufficient to guide foreign policy.	我是中文句子
They were like a young boy with a hammer who thinks that every problem resembles a nail.	我是中文句子
The danger of their approach is now obvious.	我是中文句子
Whoever plays a three-dimensional game by focusing on only one board is bound to lose in the long run.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, the pendulum has begun to swing back toward cooperation.	我是中文句子
The Iraq War, in particular, increased public awareness of the mistakes in Bush’s first term, but other issues are changing as well.	我是中文句子
Americans now view cooperative action on global climate change more favorably.	我是中文句子
The nature of these problems means that the US does not have the luxury of turning inward no matter what the outcome in Iraq.	我是中文句子
These are not problems you can leave overseas.	我是中文句子
They follow you home.	我是中文句子
It also is unlikely that American foreign policy will return to a narrow realism and drop all emphasis on democracy and human rights.	我是中文句子
When rhetoric greatly outstrips reality, others view it as hypocrisy.	我是中文句子
Americans will need to find ways to assert their narrative of democracy, freedom, and rights in a manner that respects diversity and the views of others.	我是中文句子
What Iraq has taught is the importance of developing civil society and the rule of law before trying to hold broad-based elections.	我是中文句子
Democracy is more than voting, for it requires large investments in education, institutions, and promotion of non-governmental organizations.	我是中文句子
It must be rooted in the indigenous society and bear its characteristics, not be imposed from abroad.	我是中文句子
It is highly unlikely that the US will react after Iraq as it did after Vietnam.	我是中文句子
The paradox of American power is that the world’s only military superpower cannot protect its citizens by acting alone.	我是中文句子
US Foreign Policy After the Midterm Election	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – One thing missing from the recent US midterm election campaigns was a focus on foreign policy.	我是中文句子
With the Democratic Party having regained control of the US House of Representatives, that will change.	我是中文句子
After all, in Trump’s zero-sum “I win, you lose” view of the world, congressional failures that he can blame on the Democrats are almost as good as White House successes.	我是中文句子
He has every incentive to show the newcomers up by passing the ball and watching them fail.	我是中文句子
In this new contest to pass the blame, Syria is ripe for the picking.	我是中文句子
Iran presents Trump with another opportunity to inflict political damage on the Democrats.	我是中文句子
Specifically, he wanted the ability to reimpose sanctions on Iran, which he did earlier this month.	我是中文句子
Sanctions, Trump has long maintained, would force Iran to negotiate. That has not happened and is unlikely to happen.	我是中文句子
And here, Engel might be forced to play along.	我是中文句子
Engel has said that Iran is the “most dangerous player” in the Middle East, and he was a vocal opponent of the JCPOA.	我是中文句子
The Democrats also provide Trump an out on North Korea.	我是中文句子
Engel has already said he will call a hearing on the talks.	我是中文句子
The US president, Kim could argue, can no longer be trusted with a hostile Congress at his back.	我是中文句子
Trump has already called for an increase in defense spending and the launch of a “space force”.	我是中文句子
But Democrats should resist the urge to try correcting Trump’s perceived wrongs.	我是中文句子
The House has just enough power to get into foreign-policy trouble and not enough to get out of it or to adopt and implement a coherent strategy.	我是中文句子
The Democrats’ best bet is to let Trump take the lead on global affairs, however unsavory, and actively work to check and balance his actions.	我是中文句子
Oversight and the power of the purse will be their most powerful tools.	我是中文句子
In the end, Trump will need House Democrats for money, sanctions, or approval of trade agreements.	我是中文句子
American Foreign Policy After the Mid-Term Elections	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Few Americans cast their ballot in the recent mid-term elections on the basis of foreign policy.	我是中文句子
While it may be difficult for people around the world to comprehend this, given the global reach of the United States, it is an undeniable fact.	我是中文句子
Most Americans are, after all, preoccupied with the US economy’s sluggish growth and persistent high unemployment.	我是中文句子
The world’s challenges seem far removed from their day-to-day lives.	我是中文句子
The Cold War ended a generation ago; the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are nearly a decade in the past.	我是中文句子
Most Americans do not feel the sacrifices associated with the large troop presence and ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.	我是中文句子
But the fact that foreign policy did not materially affect the November elections does not mean that the results will not affect US foreign policy.	我是中文句子
They will, but in ways that are inconsistent and even surprising.	我是中文句子
One relationship sure to be influenced by Republican gains will be that between the US and Russia.	我是中文句子
Congress may also prove less willing to remove hurdles to Russia’s admission to the World Trade Organization, given what is widely judged to be its leaders’ anti-democratic behavior.	我是中文句子
China, too, will feel the results of the new balance in Congress.	我是中文句子
Pressure was already growing to introduce trade sanctions in response to China’s refusal to allow its currency to rise to a natural level against the dollar.	我是中文句子
Such pressure will likely grow, given concerns over Chinese behavior both at home and abroad.	我是中文句子
Moreover, Congress will resist rolling back any of the long-standing economic sanctions against Cuba.	我是中文句子
There will be other consequences stemming from the election.	我是中文句子
What little chance there was of the US backing any global plan to limit or tax carbon emissions has disappeared.	我是中文句子
Improvement in US performance on climate change will have to come from innovation and increased energy efficiency.	我是中文句子
One can anticipate the Republicans, now in control of the House of Representatives, exploiting their ability to convene hearings to question and review foreign policy.	我是中文句子
In many other areas, continuity can be expected to trump change.	我是中文句子
This comes as little surprise, as America’s Constitution and political system delegate most of the initiative on foreign policy and defense to the president.	我是中文句子
Questions abound when it comes to foreign economic policy, however.	我是中文句子
Three completed trade agreements (with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia) have been languishing for years, mostly because of deep opposition to free trade from labor unions and the Democratic Party.	我是中文句子
Republicans have historically been more supportive of such bilateral free-trade agreements.	我是中文句子
But will the new generation of Republicans continue this tradition?	我是中文句子
An even bigger question mark hovers over what might be the greatest national security concern of all: the federal budget deficit.	我是中文句子
Mounting debt also leaves the US vulnerable to the decisions of those who lend it money – or to the vagaries of the market.	我是中文句子
A dollar crisis could weaken the foundations of American power.	我是中文句子
But averting such a crisis requires that the White House and Congress, Democrats and Republicans, agree on a plan for moving the US budget toward balance.	我是中文句子
Alas, the election makes such agreement more distant than ever.	我是中文句子
America’s Global Balancing Act	我是中文句子
Is that true?	我是中文句子
In brief, the decisive axis of the new order increasingly involves the United States and the People’s Republic of China.	我是中文句子
America’s supposed “pivot to Asia” took a back seat in 2014 to the crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.	我是中文句子
To what extent has uncertainty about the US commitment in Asia stoked tension between China and America’s Asian allies?	我是中文句子
I disagree with the premises of the question.	我是中文句子
I do think America has made it quite clear that it is in the interest both of America and China to avoid situations in which they will be pushed toward a collision.	我是中文句子
The recent indications of some initial dialogue between China and India, and between China and Japan, suggest that China also realizes that escalating old grievances is not in its interest.	我是中文句子
The more serious problem with the “pivot to Asia” was its actual wording, which implied a military posture designed to “contain” or “isolate” China.	我是中文句子
Xi Jinping has used his war on corruption to concentrate more power in his hands than any Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, 30 years ago.	我是中文句子
How do you see Xi’s presidency evolving?	我是中文句子
Power in China is somewhat informally defined, and its limits are set more by political realities than by constitutional arrangements.	我是中文句子
That makes it difficult to say whether Xi’s power is greater than any Chinese leader’s since Deng.	我是中文句子
He certainly has an authoritative personality and without doubt is more active on the international scene than some of his predecessors.	我是中文句子
He has also been very decisive in attacking the growing corruption that has become a major source of internal malaise, reaching even the highest levels of government.	我是中文句子
The Party elite, quite understandably, does not find this reassuring.	我是中文句子
Can Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime withstand a prolonged period of low energy prices and Western sanctions?	我是中文句子
What risks do you see emerging should Russia’s economy continue to decline, with Putin increasingly unable to reward his political base?	我是中文句子
The outcome of that would be inherently unpredictable, but probably in any case very destructive for Russian wellbeing.	我是中文句子
But that depends in turn on the West’s firmness in supporting Ukraine’s efforts to stabilize itself.	我是中文句子
Following the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, much of the world now perceives the US as being in a period of “retreat,” similar to the post-Vietnam War era.	我是中文句子
Is the US embracing a form of neo-isolationism?	我是中文句子
Or will America’s apparent inward turn be as brief as it was following Vietnam?	我是中文句子
I do not believe that the US is in a “period of retreat.”	我是中文句子
The fact of the matter is that the redistribution of global power has produced a situation in which the US is no longer the sole hegemon.	我是中文句子
The US has to acknowledge the fact that the world is now much more complex.	我是中文句子
The spread of conflict throughout the Middle East is currently precipitated more by the rise of religious sectarianism than by American interventionism.	我是中文句子
In these volatile circumstances, greater attention must be given to the national interests of countries such as Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel.	我是中文句子
By the same token, the interests of any one of them must not be allowed to become the total interest of the US.	我是中文句子
What may surprise the world most in 2015?	我是中文句子
Perhaps the gradual reappearance in Russia of a more politically assertive liberal middle class.	我是中文句子
That middle class was beginning to play a more significant role in shaping domestic and international Russian policy under Dmitri Medvedev.	我是中文句子
With Putin’s return to power and his recent adventurism, it has been pushed aside by deliberately awakened and intensely stimulated national chauvinism.	我是中文句子
Waving a chauvinist banner, however, may not be the best solution for dealing with international problems, especially if the West is intelligent and united. The Russian middle class, quite naturally, wishes to live in a society like that of Western Europe.	我是中文句子
A Russia that gradually begins to gravitate toward the West will also be a Russia that ceases to disrupt the international system.	我是中文句子
America’s Enemy Within	我是中文句子
We can dig into their family histories in strife-torn Dagestan, or examine, once again, the lethal appeal of Islamist radicalism.	我是中文句子
But I doubt that this would be enlightening.	我是中文句子
The elder brother, Tamerlan, who died in a gun battle with the police, appears to fit perfectly the profile of what the German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger calls “the radical loser.”	我是中文句子
The radical loser is the kind of young man who feels victimized by an unfeeling, uncaring world.	我是中文句子
That sour sense of rejection, felt by many confused youths, turns for some into a fierce desire for vengeance.	我是中文句子
Like Samson in the temple of Gaza, he wishes to destroy himself in a public act of violence, taking as many people as possible with him.	我是中文句子
Anything can trigger this final act: a lover’s rejection, a job application denied.	我是中文句子
In the case of Tamerlan, a talented boxer, he was denied the chance to become a champion because he was not yet a United States citizen.	我是中文句子
Radical Islamism offered him a ready-made cause to die for.	我是中文句子
More interesting, and in a way far more disturbing, has been the reaction in the US to the Boston bombings, which killed three people and injured 264.	我是中文句子
Even after Tamerlan had died, and Dzhokhar, already wounded, was the only known fugitive, the Boston authorities decided to close down the entire city.	我是中文句子
Public transport was halted, trains to and from the city were stopped, shops and business closed, and citizens were told to stay home.	我是中文句子
Until the surviving bomber was found, Boston was reduced to a ghost town.	我是中文句子
It shows how vulnerable a modern city can be when its leaders lose their nerve.	我是中文句子
This may reflect what people are accustomed to.	我是中文句子
Like the Spanish, they were used to it.	我是中文句子
Americans, despite the attacks of September 11, 2001, are not.	我是中文句子
Exaggerated fear of outside enemies has always been part of the American political landscape.	我是中文句子
The “nation of immigrants” was traditionally regarded as a refuge from danger.	我是中文句子
The evil outside world should not be able to touch the Land of the Free.	我是中文句子
When it does – Pearl Harbor, September 2001 – all hell breaks loose.	我是中文句子
Another factor may be the need for a common enemy in a country whose citizens come from so many different cultures and traditions.	我是中文句子
Besieged by Communists or Islamists, people feel a sense of belonging.	我是中文句子
Defense of the nation against dangerous outsiders – and their domestic agents, whether real or imagined – provides a powerful bond.	我是中文句子
Such bonds can be useful, even necessary, in times of war.	我是中文句子
But the politics of fear poses a danger to the US itself.	我是中文句子
The aim of political terrorist groups, such as Al Qaeda, is to provoke retaliation and maximize publicity for their cause.	我是中文句子
As common criminals, such groups’ members would not achieve this goal.	我是中文句子
But by claiming to be soldiers at war with the world’s biggest military power, they gain sympathy, as well as recruits, among the radical losers and the disaffected.	我是中文句子
Former President George W. Bush once explained terrorism as the expression of hatred for American freedom.	我是中文句子
American Hegemony or American Primacy?	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – No country in modern history has possessed as much global military power as the United States.	我是中文句子
Yet some analysts now argue that the US is following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom, the last global hegemon to decline.	我是中文句子
This historical analogy, though increasingly popular, is misleading.	我是中文句子
Britain was never as dominant as the US is today.	我是中文句子
To be sure, it maintained a navy equal in size to the next two fleets combined, and its empire, on which the sun never set, ruled over a quarter of humankind.	我是中文句子
But there were major differences in the relative power resources of imperial Britain and contemporary America.	我是中文句子
By the outbreak of World War I, Britain ranked only fourth among the great powers in terms of military personnel, fourth in terms of GDP, and third in military spending.	我是中文句子
The British Empire was ruled in large part through reliance on local troops.	我是中文句子
Of the 8.6 million British forces in WWI, nearly a third came from the overseas empire.	我是中文句子
That made it increasingly difficult for the government in London to declare war on behalf of the empire when nationalist sentiments began to intensify.	我是中文句子
By World War II, protecting the empire had become more of a burden than an asset.	我是中文句子
The fact that the UK was situated so close to powers like Germany and Russia made matters even more challenging.	我是中文句子
And, surrounded by unthreatening countries and two oceans, it finds it far easier to protect itself.	我是中文句子
That brings us to another problem with the global hegemon analogy: the confusion over what “hegemony” actually means.	我是中文句子
Others define hegemony as the ability to set the rules of the international system; but precisely how much influence over this process a hegemon must have, relative to other powers, remains unclear.	我是中文句子
Still others consider hegemony to be synonymous with control of the most power resources.	我是中文句子
Similarly, those who speak of American hegemony after 1945 fail to note that the Soviet Union balanced US military power for more than four decades.	我是中文句子
Though the US had disproportionate economic clout, its room for political and military maneuver was constrained by Soviet power.	我是中文句子
They point out that it may be rational for many countries to preserve this institutional framework, even if American power resources decline.	我是中文句子
But, when it comes to the era of supposed US hegemony, there has always been a lot of fiction mixed in with the facts.	我是中文句子
It was less a global order than a group of like-minded countries, largely in the Americas and Western Europe, which comprised less than half of the world.	我是中文句子
Given this, the US position in the world could more accurately be called a “half-hegemony.”	我是中文句子
But, from a political or military standpoint, the world was bipolar, with the Soviet Union balancing America’s power.	我是中文句子
The question now is whether the era of US primacy is coming to an end.	我是中文句子
Given the unpredictability of global developments, it is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively.	我是中文句子
The rise of transnational forces and non-state actors, not to mention emerging powers like China, suggests that there are big changes on the horizon.	我是中文句子
In short, while the era of US primacy is not over, it is set to change in important ways.	我是中文句子
Whether or not these changes will bolster global security and prosperity remains to be seen.	我是中文句子
What I Tell My Non-American Friends	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – I frequently travel overseas, and invariably my foreign friends ask, with varying degrees of bewilderment: What in the world is going on in your country?	我是中文句子
Here is what I say.	我是中文句子
First, do not misinterpret the 2016 election.	我是中文句子
Contrary to some commentary, the American political system has not been swept away by a wave of populism.	我是中文句子
True, we have a long history of rebelling against elites.	我是中文句子
And yet Trump lost the popular vote by nearly three million.	我是中文句子
If a hundred thousand votes had been cast differently in those states, Trump would have lost the Electoral College and the presidency.	我是中文句子
That said, Trump’s victory points to a real problem of growing social and regional inequality in the United States.	我是中文句子
J.D. Vance’s recent best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy compellingly describes the vast difference between California and Appalachia.	我是中文句子
These previously Democratic voters were attracted by Trump’s promises to shake things up and bring back manufacturing jobs.	我是中文句子
Ironically, Trump’s efforts to repeal President Barack Obama’s health-care legislation would make their lives worse.	我是中文句子
The second thing I tell my foreign friends is not to underestimate Trump’s communications skills.	我是中文句子
Many are offended by his tweet storms and outrageous disregard for facts.	我是中文句子
Twitter helps him to set the agenda and distract his critics.	我是中文句子
What offends commentators in the media and academia does not bother his supporters.	我是中文句子
But as he turns from his permanent self-centered campaigning to trying to govern, Twitter becomes a two-edged sword that deters needed allies.	我是中文句子
Third, I tell my friends not to expect normal behavior.	我是中文句子
Normally, a president who loses the popular vote moves to the political center to attract additional support.	我是中文句子
This is what George W. Bush did successfully in 2001.	我是中文句子
Trump, by contrasts, proclaims that he won the popular vote and, acting as though he really did, appeals to his base voters.	我是中文句子
His White House staff is divided between pragmatists and ideologues, and he caters to both.	我是中文句子
Fourth, no one should underestimate US institutions.	我是中文句子
Sometimes my friends talk as though the sky is falling and ask if Trump is as dangerous a narcissist as Mussolini.	我是中文句子
I tell them not to panic.	我是中文句子
The US, for all its problems, is not Italy in 1922.	我是中文句子
Our national political elites are often polarized; but so were America’s founders.	我是中文句子
The joke goes that the founders created a political system that made it impossible for King George to rule over us – or for anyone to ever do so.	我是中文句子
Inefficiency was placed in the service of liberty.	我是中文句子
It is still early in the Trump presidency, and we cannot be sure what might happen after, say, a major terrorist attack.	我是中文句子
So far, however, the courts, the Congress, and the states have checked and balanced the administration, as Madison intended.	我是中文句子
And the permanent civil servants in the executive departments add ballast.	我是中文句子
Finally, my friends ask what all of this means for American foreign policy and the liberal international order led by the US since 1945.	我是中文句子
Frankly, I don’t know, but I worry less about the rise of China than the rise of Trump.	我是中文句子
Despite the US-led international order’s problems, the world has prospered and poverty has been reduced under it.	我是中文句子
But one cannot be sure it will continue.	我是中文句子
The US will need to cooperate with China, Europe, Japan, and others to manage transnational problems.	我是中文句子
During the 2016 campaign, Trump was the first major party candidate in 70 years to call the American alliance system into question.	我是中文句子
Since taking office in January, statements by Trump and his appointees suggest that it is likely to persist.	我是中文句子
American hard and soft power, after all, stems largely from the fact that the US has 60 allies (while China has only a few).	我是中文句子
But the stability of the multilateral institutions that help manage the world economy and global commons is more uncertain.	我是中文句子
Trump’s budget director speaks of a hard-power budget, with funds cut from the State Department and the United Nations system.	我是中文句子
Other officials advocate replacing multilateral trade deals with “fair and balanced” bilateral arrangements.	我是中文句子
And Trump is repudiating Obama’s efforts to address climate change.	我是中文句子
I tell my friends I wish I could reassure them on these issues.	我是中文句子
But I cannot.	我是中文句子
Reclaiming American Internationalism	我是中文句子
But interventionism is not the same thing as internationalism.	我是中文句子
Conflating the two collapses the distinction between quick and decisive use of force and thoughtful engagement with the world and its problems.	我是中文句子
In America’s “get ’er done” transactional Weltanschauung, international disputes tend to be viewed as military challenges that are merely masquerading as political issues.	我是中文句子
In fact, they are usually the opposite, which is why the world’s most complex conflicts are rarely resolved by intervention.	我是中文句子
Geopolitical conflicts have long, sordid histories, and violence is more often a symptom of their intractability than an inherent trait.	我是中文句子
They often have something to do with identity, and with claims of collective ownership of the land beneath the feet of a particular “nation.”	我是中文句子
The basis of political membership is more often ethnic than civil, which is contrary to Americans’ understanding of nationhood.	我是中文句子
Moreover, contemporary problems can be the products of flawed arrangements that were made decades or even centuries ago.	我是中文句子
In both cases, creating new states may have seemed like a straightforward solution, but doing so turned out to be a prescription for more war.	我是中文句子
For the United States, international conflicts are often an occasion to demonstrate “toughness” and “resolve.”	我是中文句子
The US airstrikes in Bosnia were meant to lend momentum to a political process that already had the support of the European Union and Russia.	我是中文句子
The air campaign was a last resort, an effort to punish those who did not support the peace process.	我是中文句子
For many American pundits and politicians, then, the lesson of Bosnia was merely that the bad guys should have been bombed sooner.	我是中文句子
Few took the opportunity to study the region’s complex history so that judicious inter-entity boundaries could be drawn up.	我是中文句子
Kosovo, too, supplied more historical complexity than many were willing to grapple with.	我是中文句子
On-the-ground diplomacy to achieve sovereign autonomy for Kosovo while respecting Serbs’ emotional connection to it was derided.	我是中文句子
The implication was that military means should be the first – rather than the last – option for securing Kosovo’s independence.	我是中文句子
Never mind that many European countries objected to the creation of an independent state, and had called for multilateral diplomacy to be attempted before any discussion of air strikes.	我是中文句子
Interventionism, with internationalism as an afterthought, continued after the turn of the century, but on a much bigger stage.	我是中文句子
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US led an invasion and subsequent occupation of Afghanistan to root out al-Qaeda.	我是中文句子
But after 17 years with troops on the ground in that country, Americans have lost patience, with many embracing US President Donald Trump’s “America First” isolationism.	我是中文句子
When things went wrong in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US blamed those countries’ political leaders, denouncing them as corrupt and deserving of regime change.	我是中文句子
The Europeans, too, were denounced, not just for fecklessness in the face of evil, but for living fat and happy lives without shouldering their proper burden.	我是中文句子
American internationalism will be back at some point.	我是中文句子
But those who claim to support it could hasten its revival by acting in accordance with its original meaning.	我是中文句子
Traditional internationalists show respect for the opinions of others, and a willingness to accept – and even champion – multilateral structures.	我是中文句子
What internationalism needs now is a renewed American commitment to cooperation, even when other governments require more time to secure a mandate for action from their respective constituencies.	我是中文句子
At the end of the day, US international leadership must rest on American values, and on a broad perception of adherence to the unalienable principles underlying liberal democracy.	我是中文句子
In other words, America must lead by example.	我是中文句子
Its failure to do so in recent times – not least on the refugee issue – has undermined the influence on which its power ultimately rests.	我是中文句子
Renewing American Leadership	我是中文句子
MADRID – December always provides an opportunity to pause and reflect on what was and what will be.	我是中文句子
This year, one of the conclusions that such reflection yields is that the United States remains firmly at the center of the liberal world order.	我是中文句子
Another is that the US needs to do more to lead in the way that its international standing demands.	我是中文句子
Doubts about America’s continued global leadership have been proliferating for years.	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama’s restrained foreign-policy approach appears to be fueling, not reducing, global instability.	我是中文句子
The reasons for this lack of strong action are disputed.	我是中文句子
Some blame Obama’s own fears about repeating his predecessors’ mistakes; others blame a hostile Congress for tying his hands.	我是中文句子
In fact, both factors may be at work.	我是中文句子
It may well be true that Obama would rather exercise caution – even when bold action is called for – than act impulsively and potentially cause more damage.	我是中文句子
But the negative impact of an obstructionist, highly partisan US Congress should not be underestimated.	我是中文句子
Stalemate has become the name of the game in US politics in recent years.	我是中文句子
That is why next year’s presidential election is so crucial.	我是中文句子
It offers an opportunity for a fresh start, a new approach that produces the type of policy actions that the world needs.	我是中文句子
For starters, to avoid the kind of obstructionism that prevailed in the last eight years, the next president must engage Congress directly and actively.	我是中文句子
Even in America’s highly divisive political atmosphere, it seems, where there is a will, there is a way.	我是中文句子
It was not always this way.	我是中文句子
Today, though the need for such an order is just as great, the argument is not nearly as comprehensible or emotionally powerful.	我是中文句子
Discussion of rules and institutions comes across as bloodless.	我是中文句子
It is up to political leaders – and especially the president – to figure out how to make a compelling case about what is at stake.	我是中文句子
Only this approach can secure the mandate from the public that the next US president will need to engage effectively with other world leaders.	我是中文句子
And make no mistake: Such engagement is indispensable.	我是中文句子
While the US must play an integral role in addressing global challenges, from ending the Syrian civil war to following through on the promises of the Paris climate agreement, it cannot do it alone.	我是中文句子
Real progress will demand real cooperation.	我是中文句子
In the second half of the twentieth century, the US showed that committed leadership could help to ensure widespread stability and prosperity.	我是中文句子
In the twenty-first century, it has showed how devastating a lack of such leadership can be.	我是中文句子
Finger pointing will not fix anything.	我是中文句子
American Pie in the Sky	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – While the risk of a disorderly crisis in the eurozone is well recognized, a more sanguine view of the United States has prevailed.	我是中文句子
For the last three years, the consensus has been that the US economy was on the verge of a robust and self-sustaining recovery that would restore above-potential growth.	我是中文句子
Even this year, the consensus got it wrong, expecting a recovery to above-trend  annual GDP growth – faster than 3%.	我是中文句子
But the first-half growth rate looks set to come in closer to 1.5% at best, even below 2011’s dismal 1.7%.	我是中文句子
Of course, the drag will be much smaller, as tax increases and spending cuts will be much milder.	我是中文句子
Fourth, private consumption growth in the last few quarters does not reflect growth in real wages (which are actually falling).	我是中文句子
The US will then face not only the direct effects of a fiscal drag, but also its indirect effect on private spending.	我是中文句子
The US Federal Reserve will carry out more quantitative easing this year, but it will be ineffective: long-term interest rates are already very low, and lowering them further would not boost spending.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the credit channel is frozen and velocity has collapsed, with banks hoarding increases in base money in the form of excess reserves.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the dollar is unlikely to weaken as other countries also carry out quantitative easing.	我是中文句子
Indeed, growth in earnings and profits is now running out of steam, as the effect of weak demand on top-line revenues takes a toll on bottom-line margins and profitability.	我是中文句子
A significant equity-price correction could, in fact, be the force that in 2013 tips the US economy into outright contraction.	我是中文句子
An American Political Tragedy	我是中文句子
BERLIN – US President Donald Trump’s nearly eight months in office have been characterized by a series of disturbing political developments.	我是中文句子
But Trump is not entirely to blame.	我是中文句子
His presidency is just the latest act in a long-running political tragedy.	我是中文句子
From a foreign-policy perspective, the problem began in the 1990s, when the United States squandered the post-Cold War peace dividend.	我是中文句子
And, beginning with John F. Kennedy, presidents have likened the US to a “city upon a hill” – an example to the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
Yet it is hard to remember the last time the US produced a policy that could serve as a model for others to emulate.	我是中文句子
The country has not had a pro-active, forward-looking government since the 1960s.	我是中文句子
The list goes on.	我是中文句子
And, as the US government has retreated from society, the US has retreated from the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
These trends have culminated in Trump, whose most popular policies focus on destruction, rather than creation.	我是中文句子
Deregulation will supposedly slay the “deep state” chimera, while enabling the US to achieve energy independence.	我是中文句子
A US-centered foreign policy focused not on reshaping America’s role in the world, but on reducing it.	我是中文句子
American conservatives have so far failed to read Trump’s intentions accurately.	我是中文句子
But the truth is that Trump’s agenda has plenty of momentum; it is just focused on demolishing Obama’s legacy.	我是中文句子
The result of Trump’s approach is that America’s existing problems are worsening and huge opportunities are being missed.	我是中文句子
But what can stop demons already unleashed?	我是中文句子
And, even if they are stopped, can the damage they have already wrought be reversed?	我是中文句子
Beyond lamenting the astonishing depths to which a great political culture and system can fall, what can be done?	我是中文句子
One obvious option, which Democrats largely seem to be taking, is to reject Trump and everything his administration stands for.	我是中文句子
But that risks ensuring the persistence of the dysfunctional dynamics that brought the US to this point.	我是中文句子
Another option, however unappealing at first glance, is to accept the Trump administration.	我是中文句子
The result of such a choice may well be the worsening of domestic problems and the weakening of checks and balances.	我是中文句子
But it is also possible that checks and balances will hold until the next election, enabling America’s existing political parties to rebuild and new parties to emerge.	我是中文句子
The result, one hopes, would be a much-needed political realignment – indeed, a political renaissance.	我是中文句子
To be sure, such a shift would take time – time that, depending on how long Trump remains in office, parties may not have.	我是中文句子
Republicans may be politically handicapped for years, as they are forced to reckon with the Faustian bargain they struck for the sake of political power.	我是中文句子
And, as it stands, no third parties or candidates provide reasonable alternatives.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, there are encouraging signs that some Republicans and Democrats are thinking outside the party box.	我是中文句子
American Power in the Twenty-First Century	我是中文句子
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev has called the 2008 financial crisis a sign that America’s global leadership is coming to an end.	我是中文句子
The leader of Canada’s opposition Liberal Party, Michael Ignatieff, suggests that US power has passed its mid-day.	我是中文句子
How can we know if these predictions are correct?	我是中文句子
One should beware of misleading metaphors of organic decline.	我是中文句子
Countries are not like humans with predictable life spans.	我是中文句子
He failed to foresee that the industrial revolution would give Britain a second century of even greater ascendency.	我是中文句子
Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the apogee of Roman power.	我是中文句子
Even then, Rome did not succumb to another state, but suffered a death of a thousand cuts inflicted by various barbarian tribes.	我是中文句子
In an information-based world of cyber-insecurity, power diffusion may be a greater threat than power transition.	我是中文句子
So, what will it mean to wield power in the global information age of the twenty-first century?	我是中文句子
What resources will produce power?	我是中文句子
Today, it is far from clear how the balance of power is measured, much less how to develop successful survival strategies.	我是中文句子
We must use what has been called ‘smart power,’ the full range of tools at our disposal.”	我是中文句子
Smart power means the combination of the hard power of command and the soft power of attraction.	我是中文句子
Power always depends on context.	我是中文句子
The child who dominates on the playground may become a laggard when the context changes to a disciplined classroom.	我是中文句子
In today’s world, the distribution of power varies with the context.	我是中文句子
It is distributed in a pattern that resembles a three-dimensional chess game.	我是中文句子
On the top chessboard, military power is largely unipolar, and the US is likely to remain the only superpower for some time.	我是中文句子
The bottom chessboard is the realm of cross-border transactions that occur outside of government control.	我是中文句子
It also includes new challenges like pandemics and climate change.	我是中文句子
On this bottom board, power is widely dispersed, and it makes no sense to speak of unipolarity, multipolarity, hegemony, or any other cliché.	我是中文句子
Even in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the giddy pace of technological change is likely to continue to drive globalization and transnational challenges.	我是中文句子
The problem for American power in the twenty-first century is that there are more and more things outside the control of even the most powerful state.	我是中文句子
Although the US does well on military measures, there is much going on that those measures fail to capture.	我是中文句子
Under the influence of the information revolution and globalization, world politics is changing in a way that prevents America from achieving all its international goals acting alone.	我是中文句子
For example, international financial stability is vital to Americans’ prosperity, but the US needs the cooperation of others to ensure it.	我是中文句子
Global climate change, too, will affect Americans’ quality of life, but the US cannot manage the problem alone.	我是中文句子
In this sense, power becomes a positive sum game.	我是中文句子
It is not enough to think in terms of power over others. One must also think in terms of power to accomplish goals.	我是中文句子
On many transnational issues, empowering others can help to accomplish one’s own goals.	我是中文句子
In this world, networks and connectedness become an important source of relevant power.	我是中文句子
Abusing Churchill	我是中文句子
The story goes that when President Barack Obama moved in, he returned the bust to the British Embassy, supposedly signifying his hatred of Britain.	我是中文句子
In fact, Obama did no such thing.	我是中文句子
The bust still stands in the White House Residence, where it always did, except for a short time under President George W. Bush when it was being repaired.	我是中文句子
But Obama might have done well to remove the bust.	我是中文句子
The cult of Churchill has not been an altogether beneficial one for the United States.	我是中文句子
Too many US presidents fancy themselves Churchill’s true heirs.	我是中文句子
Bush had a copy of Churchill’s bust, lent to him by Tony Blair, in the Oval Office.	我是中文句子
He liked to portray himself as a “war president,” a “decider,” and a “great leader,” like Churchill.	我是中文句子
He had a taste for battle dress.	我是中文句子
And he got his country into a very foolish war.	我是中文句子
Trump thought this was a splendid idea.	我是中文句子
Trump is the least appropriate figure to cast himself in Churchill’s mold.	我是中文句子
Insofar as he has a coherent position on anything, he is hostile to most of the things that Churchill stood for.	我是中文句子
The resulting Atlantic Charter included everything Trump seems to be against: lower trade barriers, economic cooperation, and the advancement of social welfare.	我是中文句子
Once Hitler was defeated, Churchill was also a proponent of European unification, even if he remained ambivalent about Britain’s role in the future union.	我是中文句子
The “special relationship” between the US and Britain, established during WWII, was never as substantial as Churchill and others liked to believe.	我是中文句子
The US, as the dominant postwar power, pursued its own interests, whether the British liked it or not.	我是中文句子
And British pride in standing alone against Nazi Germany, and the self-aggrandizing notion of being America’s special partner, has prevented the United Kingdom from playing to its full strength as a major power inside the EU.	我是中文句子
American leaders sometimes pay lip service to the special relationship, to flatter visiting British prime ministers or get the UK onside in dubious military adventures.	我是中文句子
There is talk of giving the relationship a new lease of life in the age of Trump and Brexit.	我是中文句子
Again, this is precisely the route that Churchill and Roosevelt sought to avoid; after all, economic nationalism was one of the reasons why Europeans almost succeeded in destroying their continent.	我是中文句子
Of course, Trump’s love of Brexit may be just a question of words, like so much else about the great showman.	我是中文句子
It is hard to imagine the US jeopardizing its economic interests by favoring Britain at the expense of far bigger stakes in the rest of Europe.	我是中文句子
But words do matter, as Churchill knew well.	我是中文句子
Again, the rhetoric of Trump and his supporters, and of the Brexiteers, could not be further removed from the spirit of the Atlantic Charter.	我是中文句子
And Churchill’s response to the flirtations of Trump and the European far right with Vladimir Putin’s Russia can easily be imagined.	我是中文句子
None of this means that Churchill was always right, let alone a figure to emulate.	我是中文句子
He was the right man in 1940 to raise British morale, when morale was about the only thing the British had going for them.	我是中文句子
But he is not a good model for politicians in less perilous times.	我是中文句子
His views of colonial rule were already out of date before the war, and became a racist anachronism after it.	我是中文句子
His romantic ideas about the moral superiority of the English-speaking peoples were old-fashioned during his lifetime, and are an arrogant absurdity now.	我是中文句子
But Churchill was neither petty nor provincial.	我是中文句子
His vision, at least as far as the Western world is concerned, may have been romantic, but it had a certain nobility.	我是中文句子
The same cannot be said of the next occupant of the White House.	我是中文句子
The idea of Trump, advised by Farage, using Churchill’s bronze head as a totem would have filled the old man with horror.	我是中文句子
American Retreats	我是中文句子
In all of these cases, regional stability of sorts emerged after an American military withdrawal, albeit at the cost of a significant loss of life.	我是中文句子
America’s former adversaries either became preoccupied with consolidating or sharing power, suffered domestic defeat, or confronted neighboring states.	我是中文句子
Ultimately, America’s vital interests prevailed.	我是中文句子
The evidence today suggests that this pattern can be repeated when the United States departs Mesopotamia and leaves Iraqis to define their own fate.	我是中文句子
Of the four withdrawals, arguably the 1982-1984 American intervention in Lebanon marks the closest parallel to Iraq today.	我是中文句子
A country torn by sectarian violence beginning in 1975, Lebanon pitted an even more complex array of contestants against each other than Iraq does today.	我是中文句子
But the result of intervention was that US forces became just one more target, culminating in the 1983 bombing of a US Marine barracks that killed 241 American soldiers.	我是中文句子
A similar suicide bombing two days later claimed the lives of 58 French soldiers.	我是中文句子
In February 1984, facing a quagmire, Reagan acceded to Vice President George H.W. Bush’s recommendation to get out of Lebanon.	我是中文句子
But the withdrawal of Western forces did not stop the fighting.	我是中文句子
In 1992, the sirens of Somalia’s political collapse lured the US into another civil war to save a country from itself.	我是中文句子
The US committed 28,000 troops, which for a time imposed a modicum of security.	我是中文句子
The ensuing bloodbath of US soldiers generated images that the American public could not stomach, prompting the exit of American and then UN forces.	我是中文句子
In 2006, the capture of Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, by the Islamic Courts raised the specter of a jihadist state.	我是中文句子
But Somalia soon demonstrated that quagmires can be a two-way street.	我是中文句子
Following Ethiopia’s intervention, the Islamists found themselves out of power.	我是中文句子
The US, now out of the quagmire, exercises limited influence from afar.	我是中文句子
But the US saw things very differently in the 1960’s, when the ghosts of Munich hovered over Vietnam’s jungles.	我是中文句子
What Johnson failed to foresee were the domestic and regional constraints that would prevent the dominos from falling in the way he predicted.	我是中文句子
Although the US bombed northeastern Cambodia intensely throughout the Vietnam War years, it had no stomach for a ground commitment there.	我是中文句子
Still within congressional restraints, the Nixon administration attempted to bolster Cambodia’s military government.	我是中文句子
But, despite modest material support, the US could not sustain a government that could not sustain itself.	我是中文句子
Rather than the dominos falling following America’s retreat from Saigon in 1975, a Vietnam-Cambodian War ensued.	我是中文句子
This in turn stimulated China’s unsuccessful intervention in North Vietnam.	我是中文句子
None of these American exits was without consequence.	我是中文句子
But, while the US suffered costs to its reputation around the world, the supposed advantages from this for America’s opponents proved illusory.	我是中文句子
History suggests that, in fits and starts, Iraq, like Vietnam and Lebanon, will find itself able to sort out its own affairs.	我是中文句子
Gun Nation	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Defending the right of United States citizens to buy semi-automatic rifles or carry concealed weapons is akin to denying any human responsibility for climate change.	我是中文句子
Rational arguments are not the point.	我是中文句子
They will often do so with the zeal of religious believers who feel that their God has been offended.	我是中文句子
Collective identities have a history, of course.	我是中文句子
Interpretation of this amendment has been contested terrain, but the original idea was that citizen militias should be armed.	我是中文句子
For many Americans, especially in rural areas and in the southern states, this collective entitlement became akin to a God-given individual right.	我是中文句子
Demagogues have had great success pitting such people against coastal and urban elites who supposedly want to strip them of this right.	我是中文句子
The fear that demagogues exploit is rooted in more than a shared taste for hunting, or a notion of self-defense.	我是中文句子
It is about who people think they are.	我是中文句子
Take away their gun rights, and they would feel culturally and socially annihilated.	我是中文句子
But if this is the core of many Americans’ identity, it points to an odd contradiction in their national self-image.	我是中文句子
The Second Amendment is of course a legal concept.	我是中文句子
In a way, that is true of the US itself.	我是中文句子
As a country of immigrants, the US is not based on shared ancestry or culture.	我是中文句子
It is based on laws – the only way a people from so many different cultural backgrounds could be bound together in a common enterprise.	我是中文句子
No wonder, then, that there are so many lawyers in the US, and why Americans are more litigious than, say, the Japanese, who rely more on customs and traditions.	我是中文句子
If the US can be said to have a civic religion, the Constitution is its holy writ.	我是中文句子
And that is precisely how conservatives treat the foundational laws, including the Second Amendment.	我是中文句子
At the same time, however, many Americans cherish national myths, no less foundational in their way, which are in direct opposition to the idea of a nation of laws.	我是中文句子
John Wayne arrives to save the citizens from the bad guys in black suits whose nefarious deeds undermine the liberty of the American frontier.	我是中文句子
But who are those villains dressed in black?	我是中文句子
They are bankers, lawyers, businessmen, and railroad builders, often representing the interests of powerful figures in the big cities on the East Coast.	我是中文句子
They employ fighting men of their own, to be sure, but the black-suited men come from a world of contracts, treaties, and big government.	我是中文句子
The only laws the Western hero respects are those laid down by God and his own conscience. And he badly needs his gun to defend them.	我是中文句子
The Second Amendment is a sop to the myth, disguised by the fact that it is also encoded as law.	我是中文句子
Ronald Reagan understood the mythical yearning of many Americans better than most presidents, perhaps because he had acted in a number of Westerns himself.	我是中文句子
In a far coarser and more belligerent way, Donald Trump has followed Reagan’s example.	我是中文句子
In fact, he really is a kind of outlaw, with no use for norms of civility in government.	我是中文句子
Trump is a New York hustler who can tap into the fears of Bible Belt gun-lovers.	我是中文句子
To overcome the dangerous fissures that are tearing its society apart, the US must find a president who can bridge the cultural divide.	我是中文句子
Alas, it could not have chosen a man less suited to the task.	我是中文句子
My Apology Tour	我是中文句子
STOWE, VERMONT – American presidents are supposed to take America’s side when dealing with other countries.	我是中文句子
But while US presidents are not supposed to apologize for their country, nothing says that professors can’t.	我是中文句子
Here goes:	我是中文句子
Dear World: Not all Americans pay attention to foreign affairs.	我是中文句子
But presuming to speak on behalf of many who do: we are abjectly remorseful for inflicting Trump on you.	我是中文句子
Many of you deserve a dedicated apology.	我是中文句子
In alphabetical order:	我是中文句子
Dear Africa: We apologize for Trump’s obscene remarks insulting your countries in January.	我是中文句子
Dear Britain: While visiting your country this month, Trump thoughtlessly undermined the political position of Prime Minister Theresa May.	我是中文句子
Sorry for that, and for his mendacious attacks on London mayor Sadiq Khan.	我是中文句子
How can we erase this stain?	我是中文句子
We could help your countries develop, if we tried, and at a far lower cost than the doomed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.	我是中文句子
Dear China: We apologize for giving you piles of paper (Treasury bills) in exchange for all the neat merchandise you have been sending us.	我是中文句子
It’s not fair.	我是中文句子
So now you are getting real goods and services in exchange for your exports.	我是中文句子
But we would.	我是中文句子
Dear European Union: We are sorry that Trump called you a foe and that he cheers on the forces trying to fracture you.	我是中文句子
Sorry for those steel and aluminum tariffs, too.	我是中文句子
Oh, and sorry for all those refugees we unleashed on you when we destabilized the Middle East.	我是中文句子
Dear France: Your president, Emmanuel Macron, made an excellent effort to befriend Trump while sticking to principle.	我是中文句子
We are sorry that it did not get him anywhere and in particular that Trump, ignoring European pleas, subsequently reneged on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.	我是中文句子
Dear Germany: Sorry that Trump has repeatedly insulted Chancellor Angela Merkel.	我是中文句子
Usually we keep our word.	我是中文句子
Dear Ireland: We are sorry that Trump apparently believes you are part of the United Kingdom and that you like him.	我是中文句子
We know you aren’t and don’t.	我是中文句子
In fact, Japan was the only major US ally not granted even a temporary exemption from Trump’s 25% steel tariff.	我是中文句子
Also, we are sorry for Trump’s apparent indifference to North Korea’s ability to strike you (and South Korea) militarily.	我是中文句子
Dear Mexico: What can I say?	我是中文句子
We know that you will not pay to build a border wall.	我是中文句子
We know that renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement in a way that would satisfy Trump, particularly the demand for periodic renewal, is not an option.	我是中文句子
Dear South Korea: We are sorry that Trump’s eagerness to match Kim Jong-un insult for insult last year stoked fears of a catastrophic war on the Korean Peninsula.	我是中文句子
President Moon Jae-in deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for ratcheting down the risk of conflict.	我是中文句子
Dear Sweden: Sorry that Trump on February 19, 2017, fabricated a terrorist attack “last night in Sweden.”	我是中文句子
Dear Ukraine: Trump’s historical memory appears not to go back as far as 2014, when Russia invaded you.	我是中文句子
Or if it does, he says it’s okay because so many Ukrainians speak Russian.	我是中文句子
I also apologize to every country I left out of this tour.	我是中文句子
Trump’s demolition of the rules-based, truth-based, pro-trade world order hurts everyone.	我是中文句子
Please keep our seat warm at international meetings and organizations.	我是中文句子
The real US will return.	我是中文句子
Trump’s Deplorables	我是中文句子
It was neither a tactful nor an elegant phrase, and she later apologized for her remark.	我是中文句子
But she was more right than wrong.	我是中文句子
Trump has attracted many supporters whose views on race, for example, are indeed deplorable.	我是中文句子
The problem is that many of these deplorable voters are also relatively uneducated, which makes Clinton’s remark look snobbish.	我是中文句子
Alas, the United States has too many relatively uneducated people.	我是中文句子
Among developed countries, the US ranks low in terms of literacy, general knowledge, and science.	我是中文句子
Japanese, South Koreans, Dutch, Canadians, and Russians score consistently higher.	我是中文句子
This is at least partly the result of leaving education too much to the market: those with money are highly educated, and those with insufficient means are not educated enough.	我是中文句子
Does this mean that there is a link between education – or the lack of it – and the appeal of a dangerous demagogue?	我是中文句子
Perhaps it is easier for a loud-mouthed ignoramus to convince large numbers of people whose knowledge of the world is as slight as his own.	我是中文句子
But this is to assume that factual truth matters in the rhetoric of a populist agitator.	我是中文句子
Many of his supporters don’t seem to care much about reasoned argument – that is for the liberal snobs.	我是中文句子
Emotions count more, and the prime emotions that demagogues manipulate, in the US and elsewhere, are fear, resentment, and distrust.	我是中文句子
This was also true in Germany when Hitler came to power.	我是中文句子
But the Nazi Party in its early days did not find the bulk of its support among the least educated.	我是中文句子
Urban factory workers and conservative Catholics were, on the whole, less susceptible to Hitler’s blandishments than many more highly educated Protestants.	我是中文句子
Low educational standards do not explain Hitler’s rise.	我是中文句子
Fear, resentment, and distrust ran very high in Weimar Germany, after the humiliation of wartime defeat and amid a devastating economic depression.	我是中文句子
But the racial prejudices whipped up by Nazi propagandists were not the same as the ones we see among many Trump supporters today.	我是中文句子
The Jews were seen as a sinister force that was dominating the elite professions: bankers, professors, lawyers, news media, or entertainment.	我是中文句子
They were the so-called back-stabbers who prevented Germany from being great again.	我是中文句子
The Trump supporters are showing a similar animus against symbols of the elite, such as Wall Street bankers, “mainstream” media, and Washington insiders.	我是中文句子
It is a question of relatively underprivileged people in a globalizing, increasingly multi-cultural world, resenting those who are even less privileged.	我是中文句子
By cleaning out the stables, it is hoped, greatness will return.	我是中文句子
In Hitler’s Germany, this hope existed among all classes, whether elite or plebeian.	我是中文句子
In Trump’s America, it thrives mostly among the latter.	我是中文句子
Trump must thus rely on disaffected white Americans who feel that they are being left behind.	我是中文句子
The fact that enough people feel that way to sustain such an unsuitable presidential candidate is an indictment of US society.	我是中文句子
In the past, there were enough industrial jobs for less-educated voters to make a decent living.	我是中文句子
Now that those jobs are vanishing in post-industrial societies, too many people feel that they have nothing more to lose.	我是中文句子
The Double Standard of America’s China Trade Policy	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – A high-profile United States trade delegation appears to have returned empty-handed from its mission in China.	我是中文句子
The result is hardly a surprise, given the scale and one-sided nature of the US demands.	我是中文句子
This is not the first trade spat with China, and it will not be the last.	我是中文句子
China, in particular, would become more “Western” in the way that it manages its economy.	我是中文句子
Instead, the continued divergence of economic systems has been a fertile source of trade friction.	我是中文句子
There are good reasons for China – and other economies – to resist the pressure to conform to a mold imposed on them by US export lobbies.	我是中文句子
After all, China’s phenomenal globalization success is due as much to the regime’s unorthodox and creative industrial policies as it is to economic liberalization.	我是中文句子
The fact that many of China’s policies violate WTO rules is plain enough.	我是中文句子
As a Chinese official once explained to me, the strategy is to open the window but place a screen on it.	我是中文句子
In fact, China’s practices are not much different from what all advanced countries have done historically when they were catching up with others.	我是中文句子
One of the main US complaints against China is that the Chinese systematically violate intellectual property rights in order to steal technological secrets.	我是中文句子
But in the nineteenth century, the US was in the same position in relation to the technological leader of the time, Britain, as China is today vis-à-vis the US.	我是中文句子
And the US had as much regard for British industrialists’ trade secrets as China has today for American intellectual property rights.	我是中文句子
The fledgling textile mills of New England were desperate for technology and did their best to steal British designs and smuggle in skilled British craftsmen.	我是中文句子
The US did have patent laws, but they protected only US citizens.	我是中文句子
As one historian of US business has put it, the Americans “were pirates, too.”	我是中文句子
Levels of development, values, and historical trajectories differ too much for countries to be shoehorned into a specific model of capitalism.	我是中文句子
Sometimes domestic policies will backfire and keep foreign investors out and the domestic economy impoverished.	我是中文句子
Countries pursuing harmful policies that blunt their development prospects are doing the greatest damage to themselves.	我是中文句子
Many liberal commentators in the US think Trump is right to go after China.	我是中文句子
Their objection is to his aggressive, unilateralist methods.	我是中文句子
Yet the fact is that Trump’s trade agenda is driven by a narrow mercantilism that privileges the interests of US corporations over other stakeholders.	我是中文句子
It shows little interest in policies that would improve global trade for all.	我是中文句子
Such policies should start from the trade regime’s Golden Rule: do not impose on other countries constraints that you would not accept if faced with their circumstances.	我是中文句子
America’s Ongoing Civil War	我是中文句子
NEW YORK –America continues be in a state of civil war.	我是中文句子
Not just a civil war, but the civil war.	我是中文句子
In the first round, back in the 1860s, the Confederacy lost.	我是中文句子
Yet now the Confederacy is temporarily on top.	我是中文句子
The United States remains one country divided by two cultures.	我是中文句子
From the start, the US has been a battleground of two competing visions.	我是中文句子
America’s founding credo was that “all men are created equal.”	我是中文句子
Yet the founding reality was that white males were far more equal than everyone else.	我是中文句子
White men owned slaves, denied the vote to women, and took the lands and lives of native Americans.	我是中文句子
From that moment, Southern white voters deserted the Democratic Party en masse.	我是中文句子
The Republicans thereby became the party of the South, and the Democrats the party of the Northeast and Pacific West, with the Midwest and western mountain states the swing regions.	我是中文句子
The industrial Great Lakes region tended toward the Democrats while the Midwestern farm states and mountain states leaned Republican.	我是中文句子
The Midwestern and mountain states also carried the frontier culture of white settlers suppressing native Americans and Asian and Hispanic immigrants.	我是中文句子
Gun ownership marks another divide between Democrats and Republicans.	我是中文句子
The Republican Party’s gun culture reflects the same cultural forces that shape its anti-minority views.	我是中文句子
Of the 26 senators representing the 13 former Confederate states today, 21 are Republicans and five are Democrats.	我是中文句子
President Donald Trump is a geographical anomaly, a pro-southern racist from liberal New York.	我是中文句子
He is more Mississippi than Manhattan.	我是中文句子
The cultural divide was on full display in the Senate proceedings that recently confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court.	我是中文句子
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a former slave state, successfully orchestrated Kavanaugh’s confirmation.	我是中文句子
John Kennedy of Louisiana, another former Confederate state, called the hearings “an intergalactic freak show.”	我是中文句子
The Democrats and Republicans are parties not just of different cultures and regions, but also of different economies.	我是中文句子
The Northeast and Pacific states lead the US in high technology, innovation, higher education, well-paying jobs, and per capita income.	我是中文句子
The South lags far behind.	我是中文句子
Working-class southern whites would have much to gain from abandoning the Republicans’ race-based politics in favor of class-based politics.	我是中文句子
The declining predominance of non-Hispanic whites in the total population has probably widened America’s cultural divide during the past 20 years.	我是中文句子
And with non-Hispanic whites expected to become a minority of the total population by around 2045, America’s ongoing civil war could worsen.	我是中文句子
America’s Exploding Deficit	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – Two recent pieces of budget news are a grim reminder of the perilous state of fiscal policy in the United States.	我是中文句子
That temporary progress reflected the economic recovery and congressional votes to limit spending on defense and nondefense discretionary programs.	我是中文句子
But as interest rates normalize and the volume of debt grows, the cost of servicing the interest on the national debt is projected to increase to 5.8% of GDP.	我是中文句子
That projected interest cost may be much less than it would actually be if the rest of the deficit and debt forecast turns out to be correct.	我是中文句子
But investors in Treasury bonds might demand a much higher interest rate in exchange for loading up their portfolios with US debt.	我是中文句子
In that case, the interest cost and the debt would be much greater.	我是中文句子
The fact that more than half of the publicly held US government debt is now owned by foreign investors might make the interest rate even more sensitive to the debt’s relative size.	我是中文句子
Foreign investors might fear that the government could adopt policies that reduced the real value of their holdings.	我是中文句子
Here is an amazing and disturbing implication of the CBO’s forecast.	我是中文句子
There is no way to offset the growth of the mandatory programs by slowing the growth of defense and other discretionary outlays.	我是中文句子
That would be the lowest defense share of GDP since before World War II.	我是中文句子
The same reduction is projected for all non-defense discretionary programs, also a record-low share of GDP.	我是中文句子
And reducing the deficit by 3% a year would reverse the debt trajectory and bring it back to where it was in the decades before the recession.	我是中文句子
Neither of the presidential candidates has indicated either a plan or an inclination to reverse the projected rise in the national debt.	我是中文句子
But it should be a top priority for whoever moves into the White House next year.	我是中文句子
Given the need to act quickly to avoid the worst-case scenario, there is no excuse for waiting.	我是中文句子
America’s Anti-Environmentalists	我是中文句子
As an American, I am appalled, ashamed, and embarrassed by my country’s lack of leadership in dealing with global warming.	我是中文句子
Scientific evidence on the risks mounts by the day, as most recently documented in England’s magisterial Stern Report.	我是中文句子
The first George W. Bush administration was probably right to refuse to sign the so-called “Kyoto Protocol,” albeit for the wrong reasons.	我是中文句子
Among other problems, the Kyoto Protocol does not go far enough towards redistributing carbon emission rights towards developing countries.	我是中文句子
But why can’t the US bring itself to raise taxes on gasoline and other sources of carbon emission like coal burning power plants?	我是中文句子
It is not like the US government, running a huge deficit despite an economic boom, does not need the money.	我是中文句子
Many people seem to think that the Bush administration is the problem.	我是中文句子
Put a Texas oilman and his buddies in charge and what do you expect, conservation?	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, that is a facile excuse.	我是中文句子
American citizens’ resistance to moderating energy consumption for the sake of the global environment is much more deeply embedded.	我是中文句子
The evidence on global warming is considerably more muddled than Gore’s film suggests, but the basic problem is real.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, however, Gore was not successful in carrying the torch on global warming when he was a politician.	我是中文句子
One cannot commend the 1990’s Clinton-Gore administration for taking any brave steps aimed at radically reducing carbon emissions.	我是中文句子
Small wonder: the American public is fiercely resistant to anything that seriously forces them to compromise on their energy-burning, gas-guzzling lifestyle.	我是中文句子
It is not just politicians who have failed to provide leadership here.	我是中文句子
The venerable New York Times editorial page was apparently opposed to an energy tax until only recently, when the newspaper finally endorsed the idea.	我是中文句子
Like many liberals, the Times’ editors worried that higher energy taxes would fall disproportionately on the poor.	我是中文句子
The need for corrective measures to alleviate inequality is no excuse for inaction on global warming.	我是中文句子
The change of position by the Times, unfortunately, does not herald an about-face in the American electorate.	我是中文句子
Mention the idea of an energy tax to any potential 2008 US Presidential candidate, and their faces will pale.	我是中文句子
It is fine to say that you care about the environment or to claim, as Bush seems to do, that miracle technologies will solve the problem without too much pain.	我是中文句子
But any 2008 Presidential candidate that dares to talk about making sacrifices now for a safer environment later will really be sticking his neck out.	我是中文句子
Until Americans suck it up and start fixing global environmental problems that they, more than anyone, have caused, it will be difficult to get the wholehearted support of the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
Developing countries ask why they should pay attention to global warming if rich countries are not prepared to curtail their own emissions sharply?	我是中文句子
Why should poor countries worry about how deforestation contributes to global warming when rich countries remain so profligate?	我是中文句子
The scientific evidence suggests that carbon emissions from anywhere in the world have about the same impact on global warming.	我是中文句子
Such a tax is the most flexible and market-friendly approach, and would have the least impact on economic growth.	我是中文句子
Instead, the complex system of quotas favored by the Europeans and embodied in the Kyoto Protocol is likely to lead to much larger inefficiencies and costs.	我是中文句子
For this reason, England’s Stern Report is probably far too optimistic when it calculates that an eclectic approach to reducing carbon emissions will cost the world only 1% per year of income.	我是中文句子
But the Stern Report is still right to argue that the potential risks of continued inaction are far greater.	我是中文句子
America’s unwillingness to take the lead on environmental issues may some day be regarded as one of the country’s most profound political failures.	我是中文句子
One hopes that it changes course soon, before we all are forced to wear swimsuits to work.	我是中文句子
A New Low for China Bashing	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – As America’s election season nears its finish, the debate seems to have come unhinged.	我是中文句子
Get tough with China, both stressed in the presidential debates, and the pain will ease.	我是中文句子
Nothing could be further from the truth. Consider the following charges:	我是中文句子
Currency manipulation.	我是中文句子
These are hardly trivial amounts, and more renminbi appreciation can be expected in the years to come.	我是中文句子
American officials call this “manipulation,” arguing that market forces would have resulted in a sharper renminbi appreciation than has occurred.	我是中文句子
I call that prudence – perhaps even wisdom.	我是中文句子
Two lost decades later, the guinea pig, Japan, might have a view on which approach works best.	我是中文句子
Outsourcing and intellectual property.	我是中文句子
Notwithstanding some recent modest improvements in the US labor market, America’s job situation remains terrible.	我是中文句子
Private-sector employment is still down 4.1 million from its January 2008 peak.	我是中文句子
Yet there is not a shred of evidence to support bipartisan claims that this ongoing carnage is the result of outsourcing US manufacturing jobs to China.	我是中文句子
The trade deficit.	我是中文句子
Republicans and Democrats alike argue that this is the crux of America’s jobs problem.	我是中文句子
After all, trade deficits mean job losses.	我是中文句子
But neither candidate acknowledges the much bigger elephant in the room.	我是中文句子
In 2011, the US had trade deficits with 98 countries.	我是中文句子
The other 97 deficits did not magically appear.	我是中文句子
Lacking in savings and wanting to grow, the US runs massive current-account and multilateral trade deficits in order to import other countries’ surplus savings.	我是中文句子
This goes to the heart of the folly of China bashing.	我是中文句子
No leading country in world history has persistently maintained a negative saving rate.	我是中文句子
Trade deficits – with China or any other country – are part of the price that America pays for its unbridled profligacy.	我是中文句子
Simple arithmetic and basic economics tell us that a multilateral problem cannot be addressed by a bilateral solution.	我是中文句子
Politicians have a penchant for simple and powerful messages.	我是中文句子
Yet those messages are often more spin than substance.	我是中文句子
Indeed, one could argue that it is the American public that is being manipulated by the erroneous charges leveled at China.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, the campaign season is nearly over.	我是中文句子
Left unanswered, however, is what comes next.	我是中文句子
China bashers typically change their tune after a presidential election.	我是中文句子
But there is nothing typical about the pressures that are likely to continue squeezing American families long after November 6.	我是中文句子
Both Obama and Romney run the risk of painting themselves into a corner when it comes to China.	我是中文句子
That could take all of us to the edge of a slippery slope.	我是中文句子
America’s leaders need to come clean with the American people – before it is too late.	我是中文句子
America’s Coming Social Democracy?	我是中文句子
The United States is something different. Or is it?	我是中文句子
Once upon a time, according to mythology at least, America had little downward mobility.	我是中文句子
This was always half myth.	我是中文句子
Setting out for the Western Territory was expensive. Covered wagons were not cheap.	我是中文句子
But if this story was half myth, it was also half true, particularly in the years after WWII.	我是中文句子
The post-WWII period stands as a reference point in America’s collective memory, but it was in all likelihood an aberration.	我是中文句子
Corporate welfare capitalism substituted for what in Europe would have been government provided social democracy.	我是中文句子
America was thus a special place.	我是中文句子
It had its cake and ate it, too: a combination of security with opportunity and entrepreneurship.	我是中文句子
It seemed that this was the natural order of things.	我是中文句子
Hence there was little pressure for government-sponsored social democracy: Why bother?	我是中文句子
What would it add?	我是中文句子
Now things are very different.	我是中文句子
The typical American employer is no longer General Motors.	我是中文句子
It is Wal-Mart.	我是中文句子
Private businesses are providing their workers with less and less in the form of defined-benefit pensions, health insurance, and other forms of insurance against life’s economic risks.	我是中文句子
Sharply rising income inequality has raised the stakes of the economic game.	我是中文句子
A government that cannot balance its own finances cannot be relied on to provide macroeconomic stability.	我是中文句子
The coming generation will be one of massive downward mobility for many Americans.	我是中文句子
Syria and September 11	我是中文句子
The shadow of two previous events that took place on September 11 looms over the outcome – indeed, over the fact that the question is even being considered at all.	我是中文句子
More than any other event of our era, that violent coup was responsible for launching both the contemporary global movement for human rights and the American movement to promote human rights internationally.	我是中文句子
In part, this reflected the new regime’s cruelty.	我是中文句子
More than three thousand people were murdered or “disappeared” during Pinochet’s rule, thousands more were tortured by his forces, and tens of thousands were forcibly exiled.	我是中文句子
In the US, members of Congress turned the coup into a platform for efforts to promote human rights.	我是中文句子
A slightly revised version of that legislation remains in force.	我是中文句子
One consequence of the terrorist attacks 12 years ago is that Americans and others in the West became aware that developments in the Middle East could affect their own safety and security.	我是中文句子
Initially, the attacks unleashed a strong desire to retaliate, which later gave way to caution about intervention, owing to unforeseen consequences.	我是中文句子
In Britain, continuing intense resentment over the deceptions that led to the country’s engagement in the Iraq war seems to be the main reason for Parliament’s refusal to back a strike against Syria.	我是中文句子
Maintaining the international prohibition on the use of chemical weapons is an urgent concern.	我是中文句子
The Assad regime’s culpability for using these weapons is not in doubt.	我是中文句子
A critical part of its role must be to consider with care the limits that should be placed on a punitive strike.	我是中文句子
It restores human rights to the central place in American foreign policy set forth after September 11, 1973.	我是中文句子
America’s Constrained Choice	我是中文句子
NEWPORT BEACH – The conventional wisdom about the November presidential election in the United States is only partly correct.	我是中文句子
Yes, economic issues will play a large role in determining the outcome.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the potential differences for America are elsewhere, and have yet to be adequately understood by voters.	我是中文句子
Whoever wins will face an economy growing at a sluggish 2% or less next year, with a nagging risk of stalling completely.	我是中文句子
The financial side of the economy will also be a source of concern.	我是中文句子
The fiscal deficit will continue to flirt with the 10%-of-GDP level, adding to worries about the country’s medium-term debt dynamics.	我是中文句子
The banking sector will still be “de-risking,” limiting the flow of credit to small and medium-size companies and undermining hiring and investment in plant and equipment.	我是中文句子
And the household sector will be only partly through its painful de-leveraging phase.	我是中文句子
The policy front will be equally unsettling.	我是中文句子
Having dithered and bickered for too long, the US Congress will find it increasingly difficult to postpone action on these challenges.	我是中文句子
The US economy will also be operating in a more difficult global environment.	我是中文句子
In the next few months, Europe’s debt crisis will most likely worsen.	我是中文句子
Failure to do so would significantly increase the risk of an outright American recession.	我是中文句子
Serious medium-term budget reforms are needed to deal with the legacy of repeated congressional failures.	我是中文句子
It is certainly not an either/or proposition.	我是中文句子
Fiscal reforms work best in a dynamic economy.	我是中文句子
To this end, Obama and Romney will need to lift the impediments to growth and job creation.	我是中文句子
But this does not mean that there is no scope for differences.	我是中文句子
There is, and they reflect the fact that general economic tendencies will be accompanied by multi-speed dynamics at many levels.	我是中文句子
Until now, Congress’s excessive political polarization has translated into an approach that has pushed more of the burden of adjustment onto those who are less able to bear it.	我是中文句子
In an ideal world, America’s next president would rapidly embark on a two-step approach to restoring job dynamism and financial soundness.	我是中文句子
It is much more about the accompanying concepts of social fairness, entitlement, equality and, yes, standards of behavior for a rich and civilized society.	我是中文句子
It is about protecting the most vulnerable segments of society, including by providing them access to proper health coverage.	我是中文句子
It is about reforming an education system that fails America’s young people (and about providing appropriate retraining to those who need it).	我是中文句子
Among the numerous issues of fairness and equality, it is about the rich giving back to a system that has brought them unimaginable wealth.	我是中文句子
It is here where the differences between Obama and Romney are important.	我是中文句子
America’s Crony Capitalism	我是中文句子
Buenos Aires – For 20 years, Americans have denounced the “crony capitalism” of Third World countries, especially in Asia.	我是中文句子
The recently completed “stress tests” of US banks are but the latest indication that crony capitalists have now captured Washington, DC.	我是中文句子
Indeed, most professional investors trashed the tests as dishonest even as their holdings benefited from a rising market.	我是中文句子
But was it?	我是中文句子
The truth is that the tests were not designed to find answers.	我是中文句子
Both Wall Street’s chieftains and the Obama administration already knew the truth.	我是中文句子
Moreover, nationalizing banks would have required dismissing Wall Street captains and their boards for grossly mismanaging their firms.	我是中文句子
Wall Street’s titans, however, had convinced Obama and his team that their continued stewardship was essential to getting the world out of its crisis.	我是中文句子
They successfully portrayed themselves as victims of a firestorm, rather than as accessories to arson.	我是中文句子
The stress tests were meant to signal to the public that there was no immediate threat of bank failures.	我是中文句子
The feared implosion of Wall Street seems to have been avoided.	我是中文句子
In fact, the stock market bottomed out last winter.	我是中文句子
Markets had factored into share prices the belief that the US government would not allow any more banks to collapse.	我是中文句子
What the world wanted was an accurate picture of what the banks were worth and “mark-to-market” valuations to guide investors as to how much new capital they needed.	我是中文句子
None of this was either revealed or debunked by Geithner’s tests.	我是中文句子
Instead, public servants now appear to be in cahoots with Wall Street to engineer an artificial aura of profitability.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the value of toxic assets remains as murky as ever.	我是中文句子
Once sacrosanct accounting principles have been amended at Wall Street’s behest in order to allow banks to report essentially whatever they want.	我是中文句子
Calling this a Ponzi scheme might be too harsh.	我是中文句子
But few financial professionals have been fooled.	我是中文句子
Like swine flu, crony capitalism has migrated from corrupt Third World countries to America, once the citadel of sound public and private governance.	我是中文句子
America’s Dangerous Debt Ceiling Debate	我是中文句子
NEWPORT BEACH – It has been raised more than 70 times in the last 50 years, mostly without commotion.	我是中文句子
It must be raised again this summer if the United States government is to continue paying its bills on time.	我是中文句子
As part of America’s system of checks and balances, Congress gets to do more than just approve the annual federal budget. It also sets a limit on how much debt the US Treasury is allowed to issue.	我是中文句子
Beyond this ceiling, the government can spend only from current revenues.	我是中文句子
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently informed members of Congress that the government will be in this situation on or around August 2.	我是中文句子
Having already officially hit the ceiling, the Treasury is moving money around and tapping various pots of unused funds to pay its bills.	我是中文句子
In a few weeks, this “flexibility” will be used up.	我是中文句子
By holding out, Republicans wish to force President Barack Obama’s administration into massive spending cuts.	我是中文句子
Democrats respond that such a one-sided approach would be economically harmful and socially unjust.	我是中文句子
The overwhelming – and sensible – expectation is that the two parties will compromise and raise the debt ceiling before inflicting serious economic and financial dislocations.	我是中文句子
But, like many last-minute agreements, it would have little durable impact.	我是中文句子
But politicians may need two steps: an initial failure to agree, and then a quick deal in response to the resulting financial-market convulsions.	我是中文句子
In the meantime, the Treasury would temporarily re-prioritize and slow outgoing payments.	我是中文句子
The next few weeks will provide plenty of political drama.	我是中文句子
The world economy is hard-wired to the assumption of a strong America, and Americans benefit from this.	我是中文句子
But the more their politicians argue over the debt ceiling, the greater the risk that the wiring will become irreparably frayed.	我是中文句子
America’s Deepening Moral Crisis	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – America’s political and economic crisis is set to worsen following the upcoming November elections.	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama will lose any hope for passing progressive legislation aimed at helping the poor or the environment.	我是中文句子
Indeed, all major legislation and reforms are likely to be stalemated until 2013, following a new presidential election.	我是中文句子
Much of America is in a nasty mood, and the language of compassion has more or less been abandoned.	我是中文句子
Both political parties serve their rich campaign contributors, while proclaiming that they defend the middle class.	我是中文句子
The Republican Party recently issued a “Pledge to America” to explain its beliefs and campaign promises.	我是中文句子
The document is filled with nonsense, such as the fatuous claim that high taxes and over-regulation explain America’s high unemployment.	我是中文句子
Most of all, the Republican platform is devoid of compassion.	我是中文句子
America today presents the paradox of a rich country falling apart because of the collapse of its core values.	我是中文句子
American productivity is among the highest in the world.	我是中文句子
Average national income per person is about $46,000 – enough not only to live on, but to prosper.	我是中文句子
Yet the country is in the throes of an ugly moral crisis.	我是中文句子
Income inequality is at historic highs, but the rich claim that they have no responsibility to the rest of society.	我是中文句子
They refuse to come to the aid of the destitute, and defend tax cuts at every opportunity.	我是中文句子
Americans seem to believe that they have a natural right to government services without paying taxes.	我是中文句子
In the American political lexicon, taxes are defined as a denial of liberty.	我是中文句子
There was a time, not long ago, when Americans talked of ending poverty at home and abroad.	我是中文句子
For 40 years, compassion in politics receded.	我是中文句子
Ronald Reagan gained popularity by cutting social benefits for the poor (claiming that the poor cheated to receive extra payments).	我是中文句子
Bill Clinton continued those cuts in the 1990’s.	我是中文句子
Today, no politician even dares to mention help for poor people.	我是中文句子
The big campaign contributors to both parties pay to ensure that their vested interests dominate political debates.	我是中文句子
That means that both parties increasingly defend the interests of the rich, though Republicans do so slightly more than Democrats.	我是中文句子
Even a modest tax increase on the rich is unlikely to find support in American politics.	我是中文句子
The result of all of this is likely to be a long-term decline of US power and prosperity, because Americans no longer invest collectively in their common future.	我是中文句子
America will remain a rich society for a long time to come, but one that is increasingly divided and unstable.	我是中文句子
Fear and propaganda may lead to more US-led international wars, as in the past decade.	我是中文句子
And what is happening in America is likely to be repeated elsewhere.	我是中文句子
America is vulnerable to social breakdown because it is a highly diverse society.	我是中文句子
As other societies grapple with their own increasing diversity, they may follow the US into crisis.	我是中文句子
The lesson from America is that economic growth is no guarantee of wellbeing or political stability.	我是中文句子
American society has become increasingly harsh, where the richest Americans buy their way to political power, and the poor are abandoned to their fate.	我是中文句子
The world should beware.	我是中文句子
America’s Economic Stalemate	我是中文句子
That forecast, moreover, is based on quite optimistic assumptions of strong economic growth and low interest rates.	我是中文句子
The result is the current stalemate in reducing the fiscal deficit and reversing the growth of the national debt.	我是中文句子
Republicans argue that the national debt’s growth should be limited only by cutting government spending.	我是中文句子
Republicans generally reject this form of spending reduction, because it results in additional tax revenue.	我是中文句子
But the Republicans’ opposition to anything that raises revenue means that this key to breaking the budget stalemate won’t be implemented.	我是中文句子
But even though such a reform could maintain income levels for retirees, Democrats oppose it, because it lowers traditional government benefits.	我是中文句子
This reinforces the stalemate.	我是中文句子
The two parties’ hardline stances anticipate the upcoming congressional and presidential elections in November 2012.	我是中文句子
The Republicans, in effect, face the voters with a sign that says, “We won’t raise your taxes, but the Democrats will.”	我是中文句子
The Democrats’ sign, by contrast, says, “We won’t reduce your pension or health benefits, but the Republicans will.”	我是中文句子
Neither side wants any ambiguity in their message before the election, thus ruling out the possibility of any immediate changes in tax expenditures or future Social Security pensions.	我是中文句子
But, for the same reason, I am optimistic that the stalemate will end after the election.	我是中文句子
At that point, both Republicans and Democrats will be able to accept reforms that they must reject now.	我是中文句子
Another post-election route to deficit reduction would be to lower marginal tax rates and balance that revenue loss with cuts in tax expenditures.	我是中文句子
Reducing tax expenditures while lowering marginal tax rates can produce substantial revenue by increasing the level of taxable income.	我是中文句子
America’s Election and the Global Economy	我是中文句子
The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarized as follows:	我是中文句子
Spending.	我是中文句子
Obama has dramatically increased spending.	我是中文句子
He wants private markets, not government, to choose winning firms and technologies.	我是中文句子
Democrats oppose most nondefense spending cuts, arguing that reductions would cause the economy to contract.	我是中文句子
That case is strongest if the spending reductions are large and abrupt in a weak economy.	我是中文句子
If phased in over a multi-year period as the economy recovers, as Romney proposes, thrift would likely be expansionary.	我是中文句子
Taxes.	我是中文句子
Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages, capital gains, dividends, interest, and estates, especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses.	我是中文句子
Yet he has never proposed comprehensive reform of either the personal or corporate income tax.	我是中文句子
Moreover, he would run far larger debt ratios than Romney, because the main driver of the debt is entitlement spending.	我是中文句子
Entitlements.	我是中文句子
Obama has remained silent about reform of Medicare and Social Security, whose long-run deficits are several times the national debt.	我是中文句子
Vice President Joe Biden has even said that “no changes” to Social Security are to be made.	我是中文句子
Some observers suggest that Obama’s unspoken plan is ever-growing entitlements eventually paid for by a European-style value-added tax.	我是中文句子
Trade.	我是中文句子
Obama is the first US president in a long time who has not played a leading role on global trade liberalization.	我是中文句子
The Doha Round of global trade talks remains stalled, and Obama delayed the three bilateral free-trade agreements that awaited approval when he came into office.	我是中文句子
Romney is a proponent of free trade, but has said that he would be tougher on China’s trade practices and currency policies.	我是中文句子
Regulation.	我是中文句子
Romney vows an economically balanced approach that would reform Obama’s major health-care, environmental, and financial-services regulations.	我是中文句子
Appointments.	我是中文句子
Every US president appoints thousands of officials, many with considerable power.	我是中文句子
Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms, industries, or the entire economy.	我是中文句子
These policies would affect US economic growth, the budget deficit, national saving, and hence global trade and capital flows.	我是中文句子
Obama would steer America in the direction of European social-welfare states; Romney’s agenda is designed to prevent that.	我是中文句子
Whoever wins, a fiscal cliff looms at the end of 2012.	我是中文句子
With uncertainty plaguing Europe’s finances and China slowing, the last thing the global economy needs is a stagnant or shrinking US economy.	我是中文句子
But it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it.	我是中文句子
America’s Exceptional Fiscal Conservatism	我是中文句子
In Great Britain, too, leading Conservatives have recently proved willing to raise taxes and attempted to limit future spending.	我是中文句子
The United States is very different in this respect.	我是中文句子
Why do US fiscal conservatives care so little about government debt, relative to their counterparts in other countries?	我是中文句子
It has not always been this way.	我是中文句子
For example, in 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s advisers suggested that he should cut taxes in order to pave the way for his vice president, Richard Nixon, to be elected to the presidency.	我是中文句子
The framework for US macroeconomic policy changed dramatically when the international monetary system broke down in 1971.	我是中文句子
The US could no longer maintain a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and gold – the cornerstone of the postwar Bretton Woods system.	我是中文句子
This turns out to be a mixed blessing, because it has allowed the US to become less careful about its fiscal accounts.	我是中文句子
When big US banks are in trouble or Americans are having another debilitating political fight over their public finances, global investors scramble into US Treasuries.	我是中文句子
What has America done with this opportunity – arguably the lowest-cost funding in the history of humankind?	我是中文句子
Not much, in terms of productive investment, strengthening education, or maintaining essential infrastructure.	我是中文句子
But the US has done a great deal in terms of adopting tax cuts that boost consumption relative to income and lower government revenue relative to expenditure.	我是中文句子
This is the lasting legacy of the “temporary” tax cuts adopted by George W. Bush’s administration in the early 2000’s.	我是中文句子
Ryan and members of the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party undoubtedly want to cut the size of the federal government, and they have articulated plans to do this over several decades.	我是中文句子
But, in the near term, what they promise is primarily tax cuts: their entire practical program is front-loaded in that direction.	我是中文句子
The vulnerability caused by higher public debt over the next few decades is simply ignored.	我是中文句子
For example, Ryan supported George W. Bush’s spending spree.	我是中文句子
He also supports maintaining defense spending at or near its current level – resisting the cuts that were put in place under the Budget Control Act of 2011.	我是中文句子
There is no other country in the world where fiscal conservatives would want to be associated with such a high-stakes gamble.	我是中文句子
America’s Failed Militarized Foreign Policy	我是中文句子
And the proportion of youth is very high, with a bulging population of young men of military age (15-24 years).	我是中文句子
All of these problems can be solved only through long-term sustainable economic development.	我是中文句子
Yet the United States persists in responding to symptoms rather than to underlying conditions by trying to address every conflict by military means.	我是中文句子
It backs the Ethiopian army in Somalia.	我是中文句子
It occupies Iraq and Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
It threatens to bomb Iran.	我是中文句子
It supports the military dictatorship in Pakistan.	我是中文句子
None of these military actions addresses the problems that led to conflict in the first place.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, American policies typically inflame the situation rather than solve it.	我是中文句子
Time and again, this military approach comes back to haunt the US.	我是中文句子
The US embraced the Shah of Iran by sending massive armaments, which fell into the hands of Iran’s Revolutionary Government after 1979.	我是中文句子
The US then backed Saddam Hussein in his attack on Iran, until the US ended up attacking Saddam himself.	我是中文句子
The US backed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan against the Soviets, until the US ended up fighting bin Laden.	我是中文句子
US foreign policy is so ineffective because it has been taken over by the military.	我是中文句子
Even postwar reconstruction in Iraq under the US-led occupation was run by the Pentagon rather than by civilian agencies.	我是中文句子
The US military budget dominates everything about foreign policy.	我是中文句子
Another 16% went straight to the Pakistani budget, no questions asked.	我是中文句子
That left less than 10% for development and humanitarian assistance.	我是中文句子
Annual US aid for education in Pakistan has amounted to just $64 million, or $1.16 per school-aged child.	我是中文句子
They also emphasize that “US engagement with Pakistan is highly militarized and centralized, with very little reaching the vast majority of Pakistanis.”	我是中文句子
This militarized approach is leading the world into a downward spiral of violence and conflict.	我是中文句子
These places are bulging with people facing a tightening squeeze of insufficient rainfall and degraded pasturelands.	我是中文句子
Naturally, many join radical causes.	我是中文句子
Instead of seeing real people in crisis, they see caricatures, a terrorist around every corner.	我是中文句子
We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.	我是中文句子
America’s Financial Leviathan	我是中文句子
By 1960, that share had grown to 3.8% of GDP, and reached 6% of GDP in 1990.	我是中文句子
Today, it is 8.4% of GDP, and it is not shrinking.	我是中文句子
There have been many shocks to the US economy over the past couple of generations, and many factors have added to or subtracted from economic growth.	我是中文句子
There are five ways that an economy gains from a well-functioning finance-insurance system.	我是中文句子
There has been one important innovation over the past two generations: businesses can now issue high-yield bonds.	我是中文句子
Third, improved opportunities to borrow allow one to spend more now, when one is poor, and save more later, when one is rich.	我是中文句子
Households are certainly much more able to borrow, thanks to home-equity loans, credit-card balances, and payday loans.	我是中文句子
But what are they really buying?	我是中文句子
And that is not something you want to buy.	我是中文句子
Fourth, we have seen major improvements in the ease of transactions.	我是中文句子
Finally, better finance should mean better corporate governance.	我是中文句子
Since shareholder democracy does not provide effective control over entrenched, runaway, self-indulgent management, finance has a potentially powerful role to play in ensuring that corporate managers work in the interest of shareholders.	我是中文句子
And a substantial change has indeed occurred over the past two generations: CEOs focus much more attention than they used to on pleasing the stock market, and this is likely to be a good thing.	我是中文句子
And it is very possible that Philippon’s estimate of the size of the US financial sector’s hypertrophy is too small.	我是中文句子
Why has the devotion of a great deal of skill and enterprise to finance and insurance sector not paid obvious economic dividends?	我是中文句子
Are we sure that most of the growth in finance stems from a rising share of financial professionals who undertake the former rather than the latter?	我是中文句子
America’s Fiscal Isolationism	我是中文句子
DENVER – Patience might be a virtue, but not necessarily when it comes to American foreign policy.	我是中文句子
Daunting as the effort would be, its advocates assumed a sustainable political consensus to support it.	我是中文句子
After all, the United States had been attacked.	我是中文句子
Today, that consensus is unraveling as America’s politicians wrestle with a federal budget that is itself turning into a long war – one with its own casualties.	我是中文句子
The battle lines in this struggle suggest that there is little accord among political elites for any spending, let alone for a long war with far-flung commitments.	我是中文句子
As a result, basic assumptions are being questioned at every turn.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the current budget war seems to be reopening old divisions about America’s view of itself and the world.	我是中文句子
The outcome is far from certain, but even isolationism, a perennial American malady, seems to be making a comeback.	我是中文句子
But this time, as perhaps never before, a bipartisan isolationist impulse is being driven by the budget.	我是中文句子
America’s fiscal crisis is profound, and it is not just about numbers.	我是中文句子
As the emotions in Washington today suggest, the aversion to tax increases runs far deeper than concern about their effect on current economic performance and job growth.	我是中文句子
Government, as Ronald Reagan told us, is the problem, not the solution.	我是中文句子
That message is bad news for American diplomacy.	我是中文句子
School districts are increasing class sizes as they shed teachers, as well as deferring maintenance projects and curtailing the school-bus service.	我是中文句子
These cuts are having a very real and immediate impact on El Paso County’s residents.	我是中文句子
Can they, and other Americans who are losing vital services, really be expected to rise above it all and support funding to build new schools in Afghanistan?	我是中文句子
Not only are America’s public schools starting to look second-rate, but so is its infrastructure, which had long been a source of national pride.	我是中文句子
How many travelers nowadays can fail to note the difference between Asia’s new, efficient airports and the aging, clogged antiques in some major US cities?	我是中文句子
Why, people ask, are schools and roads in Afghanistan and Iraq more important than those in Colorado or California?	我是中文句子
At one point in 2008, the US military picked up the cost of transporting a tiger for the Baghdad zoo.	我是中文句子
When was the last time the US government did that for a US zoo (outside of Washington, of course)?	我是中文句子
How this debate sorts itself out will have profound consequences for how America conducts itself in the world.	我是中文句子
But it might also take a toll on how the world reacts to America’s fastest-growing export: unsolicited advice.	我是中文句子
Countries take others’ advice for many reasons.	我是中文句子
Sometimes they respect the adviser’s wisdom and insights (fairly rare in diplomacy).	我是中文句子
Or they might fear the consequences of not taking the advice (an offer one cannot refuse, so to speak).	我是中文句子
Or, as is true of many of America’s diplomatic transactions, accepting advice could open the way to a better relationship and to additional assistance.	我是中文句子
In short, diplomacy – and US diplomacy, in particular – often involves money.	我是中文句子
But what if there is no money to offer?	我是中文句子
What if Americans, tired of the budget cuts in their neighborhoods, refuse to support funds even for “the long war”?	我是中文句子
At that point, senior US officials might well arrive in a country, offer advice, and find that nobody is bothering to listen.	我是中文句子
Learning from America’s Forgotten Default	我是中文句子
LOS ANGELES – One of the most pervasive myths about the United States is that the federal government has never defaulted on its debts.	我是中文句子
Every time the debt ceiling is debated in Congress, politicians and journalists dust off a common trope: the US doesn’t stiff its creditors.	我是中文句子
There’s just one problem: it’s not true.	我是中文句子
There was a time, decades ago, when the US behaved more like a “banana republic” than an advanced economy, restructuring debts unilaterally and retroactively.	我是中文句子
And, while few people remember this critical period in economic history, it holds valuable lessons for leaders today.	我是中文句子
In April 1933, in an effort to help the US escape the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt announced plans to take the US off the gold standard and devalue the dollar.	我是中文句子
But this would not be as easy as FDR calculated.	我是中文句子
Most debt contracts at the time included a “gold clause,” which stated that the debtor must pay in “gold coin” or “gold equivalent.”	我是中文句子
These clauses were introduced during the Civil War as a way to protect investors against a possible inflationary surge.	我是中文句子
For FDR, however, the gold clause was an obstacle to devaluation.	我是中文句子
To solve this problem, Congress passed a joint resolution on June 5, 1933, annulling all gold clauses in past and future contracts.	我是中文句子
The door was opened for devaluation – and for a political fight.	我是中文句子
Republicans were dismayed that the country’s reputation was being put at risk, while the Roosevelt administration argued that the resolution didn’t amount to “a repudiation of contracts.”	我是中文句子
On January 30, 1934, the dollar was officially devalued.	我是中文句子
The price of gold went from $20.67 an ounce – a price in effect since 1834 – to $35 an ounce.	我是中文句子
Not surprisingly, those holding securities protected by the gold clause claimed that the abrogation was unconstitutional.	我是中文句子
The underlying question in each case was essentially the same: did Congress have the authority to alter contracts retroactively?	我是中文句子
On February 18, 1935, the Supreme Court announced its decisions.	我是中文句子
In each case, justices ruled 5-4 in favor of the government – and against investors seeking compensation.	我是中文句子
According to the majority opinion, the Roosevelt administration could invoke “necessity” as a justification for annulling contracts if it would help free the economy from the Great Depression.	我是中文句子
He ended his presentation with strong words: “Shame and humiliation are upon us now. Moral and financial chaos may be confidently expected.”	我是中文句子
But good lawyers still remember it; today, the 1935 ruling is invoked when attorneys are defending countries in default (like Venezuela).	我是中文句子
A key question, then, is whether governments seeking to adjust contracts retroactively may once again invoke the legal argument of “necessity.”	我是中文句子
The 1933 abrogation of the gold clause provides abundant legal and economic reasons to consider this possibility.	我是中文句子
The US Supreme Court agreed with the “necessity” argument once before.	我是中文句子
It is not far-fetched to think that it may happen again.	我是中文句子
The Maddening of America	我是中文句子
BOSTON – The relative global decline of the United States has become a frequent topic of debate in recent years.	我是中文句子
Proponents of the post-American view point to the 2008 financial crisis, the prolonged recession that followed, and China’s steady rise.	我是中文句子
The claim that the spread of severe mental illness has reached “epidemic” proportions has been heard so often that, like any commonplace, it has lost its ability to shock.	我是中文句子
But the repercussions for international politics of the disabling conditions diagnosed as manic-depressive illnesses (including major unipolar depression) and schizophrenia could not be more serious.	我是中文句子
Obsessive suicidal thinking and paralyzing lack of motivation allow depressed patients to be classified as psychotic as well.	我是中文句子
These conditions are often accompanied by elaborate delusions – images of reality that confuse information generated in the mind with that provided from outside.	我是中文句子
Often the distinction between symbols and their referents is lost, and patients begin seeing people solely as representations of some imagined force.	我是中文句子
The judgment of such people cannot be trusted, to put it mildly.	我是中文句子
Lifetime prevalence for schizophrenia was estimated at 1.7%.	我是中文句子
There is no known cure for these chronic diseases; after onset (often before the age of 18), they are likely to last until the end of the patient’s life.	我是中文句子
All of this suggests that as many as 20% of American adults may be severely mentally ill.	我是中文句子
In view of disputes over the significance of available data, let’s assume that only 10% of American adults are severely mentally ill.	我是中文句子
Southeast Asian countries appear to be especially immune to the bane of severe mental illness; in other regions, poverty, or lack of development, seems to offer a protective barrier.	我是中文句子
The US offers the widest scope for personal self-definition; it also leads the world in judgment-impairing disease.	我是中文句子
Unless the growing prevalence of serious psychopathology is taken seriously and addressed effectively, it is likely to become the only indicator of American leadership.	我是中文句子
The rise of China is unrelated to this.	我是中文句子
Obama’s Underachieving Foreign Policy	我是中文句子
Obama kept his promise to withdraw American forces from Iraq during his first term.	我是中文句子
But the move proved to be a strategic defeat, given that it significantly diminished the United States’ political influence in Iraq.	我是中文句子
Indeed, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s government is becoming increasingly allied with Iran.	我是中文句子
Obama, who opposed the Iraq war, should not be blamed for current circumstances there.	我是中文句子
But he was unable to improve the situation or help Iraq’s Shias and Sunnis reach a political compromise.	我是中文句子
In contrast, Obama expanded the war in Afghanistan – which he considered to be a war of necessity – and put the Taliban on the defensive.	我是中文句子
But the US will begin to withdraw troops after 2014, without having defined a political solution in line with its interests.	我是中文句子
US-Pakistan relations have regressed to their level before September 11, 2001, with mutual distrust minimizing cooperation.	我是中文句子
He has failed to deliver on the key promise of his Cairo speech in 2009: “to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.”	我是中文句子
And the US-China relationship has deteriorated, with America seeking to manage China’s rise strategically – for example, through regional trade agreements and an enhanced military presence in Asia.	我是中文句子
On multilateral issues, Obama’s performance is equally unimpressive.	我是中文句子
Likewise, domestic pressure has caused Obama to neglect trade issues.	我是中文句子
The US is largely responsible for the failure of the Doha Round of global trade talks.	我是中文句子
Obama’s one significant foreign-policy breakthrough has been to release the US from the grip of the “global war on terror.”	我是中文句子
After the Vietnam War, Jimmy Carter hoped to make a break with established US policy.	我是中文句子
But his administration’s actions – including serious blunders in Iran and Afghanistan – made the US appear weak and indecisive.	我是中文句子
To be sure, Obama faces a more complex diplomatic and strategic environment than Nixon faced in the 1970’s.	我是中文句子
But Obama has also struggled to define the terms of a possible grand bargain.	我是中文句子
Any agreement with Iran would require consent from Israel and the Gulf countries, which do not share the same objectives.	我是中文句子
While Obama’s first term could not be called a foreign-policy disappointment, his achievements – although not trivial – have been limited.	我是中文句子
If he wins a second term, he is likely to find it increasingly difficult to win by playing not to lose.	我是中文句子
America’s Groucho Marxists	我是中文句子
LONDON – Groucho Marx has always been my favorite Marxist.	我是中文句子
“Who are you going to believe,” Groucho once asked, “me, or your own eyes?”	我是中文句子
It didn’t matter what you could see with your own eyes. You had to accept what you were told the world was like.	我是中文句子
Reality was whatever the ruling party said it was.	我是中文句子
The designated successor to Mao Zedong in China, Hua Guofeng, raised this attitude to an art form. He was known as a “whateverist.”	我是中文句子
The Party and people should faithfully follow whatever Mao instructed them to do.	我是中文句子
Communism, like the horizon, was always just beyond reach.	我是中文句子
Democracies, of course, allow people to use their reason to make choices based on the evidence of their own eyes.	我是中文句子
When you don’t like a government, you can turn the rascals out without overthrowing the whole system.	我是中文句子
Change can be made in an evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary, way.	我是中文句子
Sometimes reason does prevail. This is what appeared to happen in the last Indian election, and the election in the United States of President Barack Obama was also plainly a supremely rational moment.	我是中文句子
But reason does not seem to be getting much of a hearing during the current health-care debate in the US.	我是中文句子
The opposition to health-care reform is a similar cause of bemusement.	我是中文句子
Its costs overwhelm workplace health-insurance schemes. The poor go unprotected.	我是中文句子
Too many of the sick are untreated. Overall health statistics are worse than those in comparable countries.	我是中文句子
Yet Obama’s attempts to reform health care have run into hysterical opposition.	我是中文句子
His proposals would lead, it is said, to the state murdering the elderly.	我是中文句子
Communism in Toronto and London?	我是中文句子
Or just better, cheaper, more reliable health care for all?	我是中文句子
Reason seems to be having a hard time of it in the US just now.	我是中文句子
Maybe it’s no coincidence that Groucho Marx was an American citizen.	我是中文句子
Gun Control After Newtown	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The brutal murder of 20 children and seven adults in Newtown, Connecticut, shakes us to the core as individuals and requires a response as citizens.	我是中文句子
The United States seems to reel from one mass gun killing to another – roughly one a month this year alone.	我是中文句子
Easy access to guns in the US leads to horrific murder rates relative to other highly educated and wealthy societies.	我是中文句子
America needs to find a better way.	我是中文句子
Other countries have done so.	我是中文句子
Between the mid-1970’s and the mid-1990’s, Australia had several mass shootings.	我是中文句子
He instituted a severe crackdown on gun ownership, and forced would-be gun owners to submit to a rigorous application process, and to document why they would need a gun.	我是中文句子
Conditions for gun ownership in Australia are now very strict, and the registration and approval process can take a year or more.	我是中文句子
Howard’s government also implemented a rigorous “buyback” policy, to enable the government to purchase guns already owned by the public.	我是中文句子
The policy worked.	我是中文句子
Before the crackdown, there had been 13 such massacres in 18 years.	我是中文句子
The gun lobby in the US remains powerful, and politicians are afraid to counter it.	我是中文句子
There can be little doubt that some societies are more steeped in violence than others, even controlling for obvious factors like income levels and education.	我是中文句子
The US homicide rate is roughly four times that of comparable societies in Western Europe, and Latin America’s homicide rates are even higher than in the US (and dramatically higher than Asian countries at roughly the same income level).	我是中文句子
What accounts for staggeringly high rates in the US and Latin America?	我是中文句子
American violence is rooted in history.	我是中文句子
The US and Latin American countries are all “conquest” societies, in which Europeans ruled over multi-racial societies.	我是中文句子
In the US and many Latin American countries, slaveholding fueled mass violence as well.	我是中文句子
The slaves – and generations of their descendants – were routinely murdered.	我是中文句子
The US also developed a particular populist belief that gun ownership constitutes a vital protection against government tyranny.	我是中文句子
The US was born in a citizens’ revolt against British imperial power.	我是中文句子
A reckless, right-wing Supreme Court has agreed with them.	我是中文句子
As a result, gun ownership has become perversely linked to freedom in the vast gun-owning American sub-culture.	我是中文句子
But, instead of protection of freedom, Americans nowadays are getting massive bloodshed and fear.	我是中文句子
The claim that gun ownership ensures freedom is especially absurd, given that most of the world’s vibrant democracies have long since cracked down on private gun ownership.	我是中文句子
No tyrant has risen in Australia since Howard’s gun-control reforms.	我是中文句子
Simply put, freedom in the twenty-first century does not depend on unregulated gun ownership.	我是中文句子
Yet US gun culture remains as pervasive as it is unrecorded.	我是中文句子
Indeed, no one even knows how many guns Americans hold.	我是中文句子
The number is estimated to be around 270 million, or almost one per person on average.	我是中文句子
According to one recent poll, 47% of households have a gun at home.	我是中文句子
Loners, often with paranoid tendencies, commit these heinous acts as part of their own suicide.	我是中文句子
They use carefully planned and staged mass murders of innocents in order to take revenge on society and to glorify themselves as they take their own lives.	我是中文句子
The perpetrators are not hardened criminals; many have no previous criminal record.	我是中文句子
They are pathetic, deranged, and often have struggled with mental instability for much of their lives.	我是中文句子
They need help – and society needs to keep guns out of their reach.	我是中文句子
And yet, each time, gun owners scream that freedom will be eliminated if they are unable to buy assault weapons and 100-round clips.	我是中文句子
The bloodbath in Newtown is the time to stop feeding this gun frenzy.	我是中文句子
Australia and other countries provide models of how to do it: regulate and limit gun ownership to approved uses.	我是中文句子
America’s real freedoms depend on sane public policy.	我是中文句子
America’s G-Zero Moment	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The 2008 financial crisis marked the end of the global order as we knew it.	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama officially ended the war in Iraq, and is withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan at a pace constrained only by the need to save face.	我是中文句子
America is handing off the leadership baton – even if no other country or group of countries is willing or able to grasp it.	我是中文句子
In short, US foreign policy may be as active as ever, but it is downsizing and becoming more exacting about its priorities.	我是中文句子
Welcome to the G-Zero world, a more turbulent, uncertain environment in which coordination on global policy issues falls by the wayside.	我是中文句子
The G-Zero world is not all bad for the US – if it plays its cards right.	我是中文句子
Its defense expenditures represent nearly half the world total, and exceed those of the next 17 countries combined.	我是中文句子
Likewise, the US continues to lead in entrepreneurship, research and development, higher education, and technological innovation.	我是中文句子
Moreover, it is now the world’s largest natural-gas producer and calorie exporter, which has reduced its vulnerability to price shocks or food shortages.	我是中文句子
No country rivals America’s promotion of the rule of law, liberal democracy, transparency, and free enterprise.	我是中文句子
While other countries certainly support these values, only the US has been willing, healthy, and big enough to ensure that they prevail.	我是中文句子
So, as America curtails its global leadership, it will find itself in more demand.	我是中文句子
Consider Asia, for example. As China’s economic importance and regional influence grows, its neighbors are seeking to deepen ties with the US.	我是中文句子
Japan, Australia, Indonesia, and Taiwan have all recently closed trade and security-related deals with the US.	我是中文句子
Even Burma has gotten on board, resuming diplomatic engagement with the US while trying to work its way out of China’s shadow.	我是中文句子
The extent to which the US will capitalize on these opportunities remains to be seen.	我是中文句子
In fact, America’s short-term advantages pose the biggest obstacle to its long-term outlook.	我是中文句子
For example, for all of the hand-wringing about America’s national debt, investors will continue to loan the US money.	我是中文句子
America’s advantages in the G-Zero world afford it the chance to invest in the future.	我是中文句子
But, by cushioning against sufficiently calamitous risks, the same advantages allow the US to procrastinate.	我是中文句子
It need only seize the G-Zero moment.	我是中文句子
America’s Houses of Cards	我是中文句子
There are times when being proven right brings no pleasure.	我是中文句子
For several years, I argued that America’s economy was being supported by a housing bubble that had replaced the stock market bubble of the 1990’s.	我是中文句子
But no bubble can expand forever.	我是中文句子
With middle-class incomes in the United States stagnating, Americans could not afford ever more expensive homes.	我是中文句子
As one of my predecessors as Chairman of the US President’s Council of Economic Advisers famously put it, “that which is not sustainable will not be sustained.”	我是中文句子
But the patterns are systematic, with consequences that unfold gradually, and painfully, over time.	我是中文句子
There is a macro-story and a micro-story here.	我是中文句子
The macro-story is simple, but dramatic.	我是中文句子
Some, observing the crash of the sub-prime mortgage market, say, “Don’t worry, it is only a problem in the real estate sector.”	我是中文句子
Booming home prices gave Americans the confidence, and the financial wherewithal, to spend more than their income.	我是中文句子
America’s household savings rate was at levels not seen since the Great Depression, either negative or zero.	我是中文句子
With higher interest rates depressing housing prices, the game is over.	我是中文句子
The micro-story is more dramatic.	我是中文句子
Instead, easy money stimulated the economy by inducing households to refinance their mortgages, and to spend some of their capital.	我是中文句子
It is one thing to borrow to make an investment, which strengthens balance sheets; it is another thing to borrow to finance a vacation or a consumption binge.	我是中文句子
But this is what Alan Greenspan encouraged Americans to do.	我是中文句子
When normal mortgages did not prime the pump enough, he encouraged them to take out variable-rate mortgages – at a time when interest rates had nowhere to go but up.	我是中文句子
The only way (in this view) not to win was to sit on the sidelines.	我是中文句子
All of this amounted to a human and economic disaster in the making.	我是中文句子
Now reality has hit: newspapers report cases of borrowers whose mortgage payments exceed their entire income.	我是中文句子
Globalization implies that America’s mortgage problem has worldwide repercussions.	我是中文句子
The first run on a bank occurred against the British mortgage lender Northern Rock.	我是中文句子
America managed to pass off bad mortgages worth hundreds of billions of dollars to investors (including banks) around the world.	我是中文句子
In the face of such uncertainty, markets froze.	我是中文句子
Those in financial markets who believe in free markets have temporarily abandoned their faith.	我是中文句子
For the greater good of all (of course, it is never for their own selfish interests), they argued a bailout was necessary.	我是中文句子
But those from whom they buy them should provide a guarantee, so the public does not have to pay the price for their bad investment decisions.	我是中文句子
Equity owners in banks should not get a free ride.	我是中文句子
Securitization, with all of its advantages in sharing risk, has three problems that were not adequately anticipated.	我是中文句子
While it meant that American banks were not hit as hard as they would otherwise, America’s bad lending practices have had global effects.	我是中文句子
(As economists would say, problems of asymmetric information have increased.)	我是中文句子
In the old days, when borrowers found it impossible to make their payments, mortgages would be restructured; foreclosures were bad for both the borrower and the lender.	我是中文句子
Securitization made debt restructuring difficult, if not impossible.	我是中文句子
It is the victims of predatory lenders who need government help.	我是中文句子
With mortgages amounting to 95% or more of the value of the house, debt restructuring will not be easy.	我是中文句子
America’s Interest-Rate Puzzle	我是中文句子
A great puzzle in today’s world economy is the continued low level of long-term real interest rates in the United States.	我是中文句子
So we expect a substantial depreciation premium on US interest rates.	我是中文句子
If it falls 40% against the yen sometime in the next ten years, US long-term interest rates should be four percentage points higher than Japanese rates.	我是中文句子
If it falls 60% against China’s currency, the yuan, sometime in the next ten years, US long-term interest rates should be six percentage points higher than Chinese rates.	我是中文句子
But we are not seeing signs of anything like this.	我是中文句子
The puzzle is not only that long-term rates are too low when viewed in the international context, but also that they are too low when viewed in America’s domestic context.	我是中文句子
In this case, the price of loanable funds is the real interest rate.	我是中文句子
An expectation that interest rates will be high sometime in the next decade should mean high interest rates on long-term bonds today.	我是中文句子
Yet financial markets are not pricing dollar depreciation and a rise in long-term US interest rates accordingly.	我是中文句子
When we macroeconomists talk to our friends on Wall Street, we find that they don’t view this as a puzzle at all.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, they are puzzled about why we view the current low level of US long-term interest rates as worrisome.	我是中文句子
By doing so, they will push prices close to fundamentals today.	我是中文句子
And trades do go wrong: remember the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management.	我是中文句子
The existence of large financial-market actors that do not care about maximizing their profits magnifies the riskiness of the bets.	我是中文句子
For where should they park their money?	我是中文句子
But America’s businesses see enough risk in the future to be wary of getting stuck with unutilized capacity.	我是中文句子
Economists believe that market forces drive prices to fundamentals.	我是中文句子
But we are not careful enough to distinguish situations in which equilibrium-restoring forces are strong from those in which such forces are weak.	我是中文句子
When that happens, the long-run future will be now.	我是中文句子
America’s Islamist Allies of Convenience	我是中文句子
NEW DELHI – In just one decade, the United States has intervened militarily in three Muslim-majority countries and overthrown their governments.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the last “humanitarian intervention” has clearly backfired, turning Libya into a breeding ground for transnational militants.	我是中文句子
As the intense US debate about President Barack Obama’s proposed use of military force highlights, the attack-Syria push is not about upholding America’s national interest.	我是中文句子
Rather, the desire to protect US “credibility” has become the last refuge of those seeking yet another war in the wider Middle East.	我是中文句子
Indeed, an attack would most likely increase America’s reliance on unsavory Islamist rulers in countries ranging from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.	我是中文句子
Likewise, regime change in Libya aided the rise of Al Qaeda-linked militants, leading to the killing in Benghazi of the US ambassador.	我是中文句子
A system based on sharia (Islamic law) has been imposed, human-rights abuses are legion, and cross-border movement of weapons and militants has undermined the security of Libya’s neighbors.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, America’s support for the regimes in Yemen and Saudi Arabia has contributed to the rise of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.	我是中文句子
In parts of southern Yemen, an Al Qaeda affiliate, Ansar al-Sharia, functions as a de facto government.	我是中文句子
Airstrikes now would merely make matters worse by undercutting the FSA’s grassroots legitimacy and aiding Islamist forces.	我是中文句子
That simply will not work, even in the short term.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, until the Egyptian army removed him from the presidency, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi was coming to be seen by many as America’s man in Cairo.	我是中文句子
By supporting Islamist rulers, the US is contributing to a trend evident from the Maghreb to the badlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan – Muslims killing Muslims.	我是中文句子
American policy has also contributed to a growing conflict between Islamist and secular forces in Muslim countries.	我是中文句子
This is best illustrated by Turkey, where Obama has ignored Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s heavy-handed efforts to annul free speech and turn himself into a twenty-first-century Sultan.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the clash within Islam is likely to be destabilizing regionally and counterproductive to the interests of the free world.	我是中文句子
Against this background, Obama should heed the doctrine proposed in 1991 by General Colin Powell.	我是中文句子
Drone Wars	我是中文句子
His sentiment seems more apt than ever nowadays, but not because humanity has turned pacifistic.	我是中文句子
Rather, wars are increasingly fought remotely, with drones – or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – doing the killing.	我是中文句子
In March 2011, the US Air Force for the first time trained more pilots for drones than for any other purpose.	我是中文句子
This raises serious ethical questions.	我是中文句子
With no military personnel risking their lives, UAVs make it easier to kill, and to justify war operations to the public at home.	我是中文句子
Moreover, a human being’s reticence to kill is inversely related to the distance between attacker and target.	我是中文句子
In the case of a pilot flying drones over Yemen by operating a joystick in Nevada, the threshold to pulling the trigger is dangerously low.	我是中文句子
Killing is just a part of the job, to be followed by bowling, perhaps, or a quiet evening at home.	我是中文句子
From a legal and human-rights point of view, the US drone program is even more alarming.	我是中文句子
After all, countries such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia do not belong to declared war zones.	我是中文句子
Outside the context of war, in turn, state killings are legal only if they prove absolutely necessary to save lives.	我是中文句子
More than a decade after September 11, America’s drone program does not fall into the first category of reactive self-defense.	我是中文句子
So, Koh claims, drone attacks are part of a global war, fought both in declared war zones and non-war countries; therefore, they are legal.	我是中文句子
But, even under this adventurous assumption, human-rights issues arise.	我是中文句子
The laws of war condone targeted killings only of “combatants” who “directly participate in hostilities.”	我是中文句子
The killings must be proportionate, strategically necessary, and publicly justified.	我是中文句子
Avoiding harm to civilians should be the top priority.	我是中文句子
At the slightest sign of illegality, an investigation must be conducted, offenders prosecuted, and victims compensated.	我是中文句子
The US drone program’s legal basis is entirely unclear, however.	我是中文句子
Given that most information about UAV activity is classified, it is impossible to know whether all drone targets directly participated in hostilities.	我是中文句子
Others estimate a lower, but still alarming, rate of 30%.	我是中文句子
The legal obligation of proportionality is clearly being violated.	我是中文句子
Accountability is also being flouted.	我是中文句子
Drone operations are carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency, an organization whose activities are shrouded in secrecy.	我是中文句子
And, unlike military personnel, CIA agents enjoy extensive immunity, undermining international legal standards.	我是中文句子
Without increased transparency, to declare America’s UAV campaign legal is impossible, both in the context of war and outside of armed conflict.	我是中文句子
Victims of UAV attacks, their families, and civil-society groups have begun to speak out against America’s questionable drone campaign, and to pursue legal action.	我是中文句子
Others should feel encouraged to follow suit.	我是中文句子
America’s Locust Years	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – It is hard right now to write about American political economy.	我是中文句子
Nobody knows whether the debt-ceiling tripwire will be evaded; if so, how; or what will happen if it is not.	我是中文句子
Or the US Federal Reserve, the Peoples Bank of China (PBC), or both – or even some other body – could support the market.	我是中文句子
Frankly, no one knows what legislative deal will be struck to raise the debt ceiling.	我是中文句子
The risks imposed by global warming, for example, have not gone away.	我是中文句子
The sooner the world starts preparing to deal with those threats, the better.	我是中文句子
Another six months should not be lost.	我是中文句子
The employment-to-population ratio in the US remains flat – mired at the very low levels to which it fell during the recession.	我是中文句子
But opportunities to pursue the necessary policies have not been grasped.	我是中文句子
Here, too, another six months should not be lost.	我是中文句子
The mandarins of northern Europe continue to measure out a drip-feed of support with coffee spoons.	我是中文句子
Another six months have been lost.	我是中文句子
But so far in the third millennium, this skill – or simply run of luck – has deserted the US.	我是中文句子
It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that the problem is one not only for the US, but for the rest of the world as well.	我是中文句子
Since December 7, 1941, the world has in large part been able to rely on global governance by a somewhat-competent hyperpower.	我是中文句子
That America may be gone for good.	我是中文句子
If it is, the world needs to develop other institutions for global management – and quickly.	我是中文句子
America’s Misguided Immigration Debate	我是中文句子
A debate on immigration is beginning in the United States Senate, which will take up several proposals.	我是中文句子
Another idea is to require anyone in the US wanting to regularize their immigration status to go home and wait in line there.	我是中文句子
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter’s compromise proposal.	我是中文句子
What’s missing in the debate is the Latin American context.	我是中文句子
There was a time when north-south migratory flows in the western hemisphere were limited to Mexico and the Caribbean.	我是中文句子
Today, even Brazil, traditionally a country of immigration, has become one of emigration.	我是中文句子
Their remittances contribute immensely to the economic welfare of their families, communities, and home countries’ economies.	我是中文句子
Thus, whatever immigration policy emerges in the US will have an enormous impact south of the Rio Grande well beyond Mexico.	我是中文句子
If the perception of further US hostility toward Latin America persists, the tilt toward an irresponsible, demagogic left will harden.	我是中文句子
The responsible left in Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay are an exception to the emerging rule set by Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez.	我是中文句子
The best way to accentuate the region’s growing anti-American sentiment is to try to close the US-Mexican border (which will be futile).	我是中文句子
Bush must begin to use what political capital he has left to support enlightened immigration reform, along the lines of the Kennedy-McCain bill.	我是中文句子
Mexico and the US must be sensitive to domestic political concerns in both countries.	我是中文句子
Mexico must act on what Fox has called “shared responsibility.”	我是中文句子
Mexico has to assume responsibility for regulating this traffic, which means more than sealing off its southern border.	我是中文句子
Fox has said that he is willing to break with old Mexican taboos, but the Bush administration has never taken him up on it.	我是中文句子
That is unfortunate, because Fox will not be around forever.	我是中文句子
Immigration has always been an immensely complex and delicate issue inside the US, and now for Latin America as well.	我是中文句子
A window of opportunity opened at the beginning of Bush’s first term, and closed shut after the terrorist attacks of September 2001.	我是中文句子
It is opening again and should be taken advantage of before it is too late.	我是中文句子
Why Iran Won’t Budge	我是中文句子
TEL AVIV – No one really believed that the latest round of international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would produce a breakthrough.	我是中文句子
America’s belief that a harsh sanctions regime could coax Iran into a deal has proved – at least so far – to be unrealistic.	我是中文句子
To be sure, Iran’s alliances are vulnerable to erosion and, in the case of two staunch allies, Syria and Venezuela, to outright collapse.	我是中文句子
China’s Iranian interests boil down to economics.	我是中文句子
True, China cannot entirely overlook US pressure and the staunch opposition of its top oil supplier, Saudi Arabia, to Iran’s nuclear program.	我是中文句子
But, while China has supported the mandatory sanctions set by the United Nations Security Council, it has rejected the West’s unilateral measures.	我是中文句子
With bilateral trade worth only about $5 billion annually, Russia’s economic interests in Iran are fairly modest.	我是中文句子
But it fears Iran’s ability to cause trouble, particularly by stirring up unrest among Russia’s Muslim citizens.	我是中文句子
The problem with the US drive to have key stakeholders join its anti-Iran crusade is that some of them live in neighborhoods where Iran is an important factor.	我是中文句子
India is a case in point.	我是中文句子
As a result, India’s policy mirrors China’s: it has aligned itself with mandatory international sanctions, but has abjured voluntary Western financial restrictions.	我是中文句子
The equivocal nature of Iran’s alliances, however, can be a mixed blessing.	我是中文句子
Yes, a harsh sanctions regime might still gain additional supporters, but an Iran with its back against the wall would probably be even more obstinate in its nuclear drive.	我是中文句子
After all, Iraq was an easy target in the first Gulf War precisely because it had abandoned its nuclear program, and possessed no weapons of mass destruction.	我是中文句子
Similarly, Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi exposed himself to a NATO onslaught by relinquishing his WMDs.	我是中文句子
By contrast, North Korea shows that defiance, rather than accommodation, is a strategy that works.	我是中文句子
Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity as “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” could be applied to America’s Iran policy.	我是中文句子
The diplomacy of sanctions, ostracism, and brinkmanship has failed resoundingly.	我是中文句子
As Iran’s uranium-enrichment and other weapons-development activities continue unabated, the US needs to make a break with the old rules of engagement.	我是中文句子
America’s Misplaced Deficit Complacency	我是中文句子
Regarded as an urgent problem until recently, the federal deficit is now being placed on the back burner of American politics.	我是中文句子
According to the CBO’s report, the US fiscal deficit will decline from 7% of GDP in 2012 to 4% in 2013.	我是中文句子
That path of deficits implies that the government debt/GDP ratio will remain at about the current level of 75% for the next ten years.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, these headline-grabbing numbers are not likely to be borne out in reality; indeed, even the CBO does not believe that they represent what will occur.	我是中文句子
Instead, these official forecasts represent a “baseline” scenario that the CBO is required to present.	我是中文句子
The CBO’s “baseline budget” assumes that all of the deficit-reducing features in current law will remain unchanged.	我是中文句子
And those estimates are based on the optimistic assumption that the economy will have returned gradually to full employment with low inflation and moderate interest rates.	我是中文句子
Officials and others who favor stimulating growth through increased government spending ignore the CBO’s more realistic alternative scenario.	我是中文句子
A large and rising national debt is a serious danger to an economy’s health.	我是中文句子
Higher debt-service costs require higher tax rates, which in turn weaken incentives and reduce economic growth.	我是中文句子
By the end of the decade, the US will have to pay an amount equivalent to more than one-third of the revenue from personal-income taxes just to pay the interest on the national debt.	我是中文句子
Foreign investors now hold more than half of that debt.	我是中文句子
Paying interest to them requires sending more goods and services to the rest of the world than the US receives from the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
That requires a weaker dollar to make US goods more attractive to foreign buyers and to make foreign goods more expensive to American consumers.	我是中文句子
The weaker dollar reduces the US standard of living.	我是中文句子
A large national debt also limits the government’s ability to respond to emergencies, including both military threats and economic downturns.	我是中文句子
And it makes the US vulnerable to changes in financial-market sentiment, as the European experience has shown.	我是中文句子
Reducing future deficits and reversing the rise in the national debt require raising tax revenue and slowing the growth of government pension and health-care programs.	我是中文句子
Tax revenue can be raised without increasing marginal tax rates by limiting the tax subsidies that are built into the current tax code.	我是中文句子
Those subsidies are a hidden form of government spending on everything from home mortgages and health insurance to the purchase of hybrid cars and residential solar panels.	我是中文句子
Slowing the growth of the pension and health-care programs for middle-class retirees cannot be done abruptly.	我是中文句子
It must begin by giving notice to those who are now a decade away from retirement – which is why it is important to launch such reforms now.	我是中文句子
Merely moving the problem to the back burner will not prevent it from boiling over.	我是中文句子
Meeting America’s Growth Challenge	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – The United States continues to recover from its deepest economic slump since the Great Depression, but the pace of recovery remains frustratingly slow.	我是中文句子
There are several reasons to anticipate modest improvement in 2013, although, as usual, there are downside risks.	我是中文句子
Prolonged recession or a financial crisis in Europe and slower growth in emerging markets are the main external sources of potential danger.	我是中文句子
At home, political infighting underlies the two greatest risks: failure to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling and an additional round of fiscal contraction that stymies economic growth.	我是中文句子
Since 2010, tepid average annual GDP growth of 2.1% has meant weak job creation.	我是中文句子
In both this recovery and the previous two, the rebound in employment growth has been weaker and later than the rebound in GDP growth.	我是中文句子
Weak aggregate demand is the primary culprit for subdued GDP and employment growth.	我是中文句子
The 2008 recession was triggered by a financial crisis that erupted after the collapse of a credit-fueled asset bubble decimated the housing market.	我是中文句子
Private-sector demand contracts sharply and recovers only slowly after such crises.	我是中文句子
This represents the sharpest contraction and weakest recovery in private-sector demand since the end of World War II.	我是中文句子
Growth in two components of private demand, residential investment and consumption, which account for more than 75% of total spending in the US economy, has been especially slow.	我是中文句子
Both sources of demand are likely to strengthen in 2013.	我是中文句子
But the headwinds in the housing market are dissipating.	我是中文句子
Home sales, prices, and construction all rose last year, while foreclosures declined.	我是中文句子
Residential investment should be a source of output and job growth this year.	我是中文句子
To be sure, the balance-sheet headwinds holding back consumption have eased.	我是中文句子
But consumption will be hit by the expiration of the payroll tax cut, which will reduce household income by about $125 billion this year.	我是中文句子
Another factor holding back recovery has been weak growth in spending on goods and services by both state and local governments, and more recently by the federal government.	我是中文句子
Indeed, since the recession’s onset, state and local governments have cut nearly 600,000 jobs and reduced spending for infrastructure projects by 20%.	我是中文句子
The fiscal trends for 2013 are mixed, but negative overall.	我是中文句子
While state and local government cutbacks in spending and employment are ending as the recovery boosts their tax revenues, the fiscal drag at the federal level is strengthening.	我是中文句子
In addition, although less widely appreciated, significant reductions in federal spending are already under way, with more likely to come.	我是中文句子
Based on current economic assumptions, the US needs about $4 trillion in savings to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio over the next decade.	我是中文句子
It is already three-fifths of the way there.	我是中文句子
The so-called sequester (the across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to begin in March), would slash another $100 billion this year and $1.2 trillion over the next decade.	我是中文句子
Moreover, despite the warnings of deficit alarmists, the US does not face an imminent debt crisis.	我是中文句子
Currently, the federal debt held by the public is just over 70% of GDP, a level not seen since the early 1950’s.	我是中文句子
Nor is it alarming.	我是中文句子
The considerable progress that has been made on deficit reduction over the next ten years has been overlooked.	我是中文句子
Also overlooked have been the immediate challenges of low growth, weak investment, and high unemployment.	我是中文句子
It is time to refocus.	我是中文句子
The US needs a plan for faster growth, not more deficit reduction.	我是中文句子
We should heed his wisdom.	我是中文句子
America’s New Progressive Era?	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – In 1981, US President Ronald Reagan came to office famously declaring that, “Government is not the solution to our problem.	我是中文句子
Government is the problem.”	我是中文句子
Reagan’s statement in 1981 was extraordinary.	我是中文句子
It signaled that America’s new president was less interested in using government to solve society’s problems than he was in cutting taxes, mainly for the benefit of the wealthy.	我是中文句子
These special interests included Wall Street, Big Oil, the big health insurers, and arms manufacturers.	我是中文句子
For more than three decades, no one really challenged the consequences of turning political power over to the highest bidders.	我是中文句子
In the meantime, America went from being a middle-class society to one increasingly divided between rich and poor.	我是中文句子
CEOs who were once paid around 30 times what their average workers earned now make around 230 times that amount.	我是中文句子
Once a world leader in the fight against environmental degradation, America was the last major economy to acknowledge the reality of climate change.	我是中文句子
Financial deregulation enriched Wall Street, but ended up creating a global economic crisis through fraud, excessive risk-taking, incompetence, and insider dealing.	我是中文句子
Maybe, just maybe, Obama’s recent address marks not only the end of this destructive agenda, but also the start of a new era.	我是中文句子
It was the first inaugural address of its kind since Reagan turned America away from government in 1981.	我是中文句子
The subsequent Progressive Era was followed by a temporary return to plutocracy in the 1920’s.	我是中文句子
Then came the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, and another 30 years of progressive politics, from the 1930’s to the 1960’s.	我是中文句子
The 1970’s were a transition period to the Age of Reagan – 30 years of conservative politics led by powerful corporate interests.	我是中文句子
It is certainly too early to declare a new Progressive Era in America.	我是中文句子
Vested interests remain powerful, certainly in Congress – and even within the White House.	我是中文句子
These wealthy groups and individuals gave billions of dollars to the candidates in the recent election campaign, and they expect their contributions to yield benefits.	我是中文句子
Moreover, 30 years of tax cutting has left the US government without the financial resources needed to carry out effective programs in key areas such as the transition to low-carbon energy.	我是中文句子
Still, Obama has wisely thrown down the gauntlet, calling for a new era of government activism.	我是中文句子
Implementation of public policy is just as important to good governance as the vision that underlies it.	我是中文句子
So the next task is to design wise, innovative, and cost-effective programs to address these challenges.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, when it comes to bold and innovative programs to meet critical human needs, America is out of practice.	我是中文句子
It is time to begin anew, and Obama’s full-throated defense of a progressive vision points the US in the right direction.	我是中文句子
America’s New Trade Hypocrisy	我是中文句子
Nowhere is this clearer than in a provision that is supposed to give the least developed countries almost duty-free access to developed countries’ markets.	我是中文句子
A year ago, the leaders of the world’s richest countries committed themselves to alleviating the plight of the poorest.	我是中文句子
The opening was less than it seemed.	我是中文句子
But the coup de grace was delivered by the world’s richest country, the United States, which once again decided to demonstrate its hypocrisy.	我是中文句子
The US ostensibly agreed to a 97% opening of its markets to the poorest countries.	我是中文句子
America’s intention was, to the contrary, to seem to be opening up its markets, while doing nothing of the sort, for it appears to allow the US to select a different 3% for each country.	我是中文句子
The result is what is mockingly coming to be called the EBP initiative: developing countries will be allowed freely to export everything but what they produce.	我是中文句子
Consider Bangladesh.	我是中文句子
But its top 12 tariff lines – 3% of all tariff lines – accounted for 59.7% of the total value of its exports to the US.	我是中文句子
This means that the US could erect barriers to almost three-fifths of Bangladeshi exports.	我是中文句子
For Cambodia, the figure would be about 62%.	我是中文句子
For Bangladesh, this implies that 75% of the tariff lines, accounting for more than 90% of the value of its exports to the US, could be excluded from duty-free treatment.	我是中文句子
The official argument for the 3% exclusion is that it affects “sensitive products.”	我是中文句子
In other words, while the US lectures developing countries on the need to face the pain of rapid adjustment to liberalization, it refuses to do the same.	我是中文句子
(Indeed, it has already had more than 11 years to adjust to liberalization of textiles.)	我是中文句子
The whole exclusion simply undermines the multilateral trading system.	我是中文句子
Indeed, there may be a further hidden agenda behind the 97% proposal.	我是中文句子
It was imperative that such unity be destroyed.	我是中文句子
America’s strategy of bilateral trade agreements was aimed at precisely that, but it enlisted only a few countries, representing a fraction of global trade.	我是中文句子
The 97% formula holds open the possibility of extending that fragmentation into the WTO itself.	我是中文句子
The US has already had some success in pitting the poor against each other.	我是中文句子
For example, Bangladesh’s share in US clothing markets declined from 4.6% in 2001 to 3.9% in 2004.	我是中文句子
The WTO is supposed to prevent these trade-diversionary agreements, but so far no case has been successfully brought.	我是中文句子
Even if America succeeds in dividing the developing countries, however, it may inspire a degree of unity elsewhere.	我是中文句子
Both those committed to trade liberalization within a multilateral system and those committed to helping developing countries will look at America’s new strategy with abhorrence.	我是中文句子
Game Changers for Growth	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – The recent G-20 meeting of finance ministers in Saint Petersburg confirmed that the debate between growth and austerity is over – at least for now.	我是中文句子
With protracted recession in Europe and slowdowns in emerging markets, concern about budget deficits has given way to apprehension about growth.	我是中文句子
In July, the International Monetary Fund revised its global growth forecast downward for the second time this year.	我是中文句子
Both Japan and the United States stand out as bright spots in the subdued global outlook, but for different reasons.	我是中文句子
In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has unleashed a combination of aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion along with promised reforms of the labor market, corporate governance, regulation, and trade.	我是中文句子
Now Abe has signaled his intention to move forward with tough structural reforms.	我是中文句子
If he delivers, his policies will be game changers for Japan.	我是中文句子
In the US, the story is one of continued recovery as the headwinds slowing growth dissipate.	我是中文句子
State- and local-government budgets are improving, the housing market is strengthening, and households are deleveraging and repairing their balance sheets.	我是中文句子
Counterproductive and excessive fiscal austerity at the federal level has dampened growth this year, but the private sector has proved more resilient than expected.	我是中文句子
Under current law, fiscal contraction is slated to ease next year and monetary policy is likely to remain supportive, so most forecasters predict an acceleration of growth.	我是中文句子
But growth prospects could be undermined by another bruising political battle over the federal budget, resulting in deep spending cuts.	我是中文句子
The current Republican rhetoric in the House of Representatives portends additional fiscal austerity.	我是中文句子
Still, there are often-overlooked reasons for optimism about America’s future potential growth.	我是中文句子
US production of shale gas and oil has been growing by more than 50% annually over the last five years.	我是中文句子
This price advantage will enhance America’s competitiveness as a manufacturing location, particularly for energy-intensive activities.	我是中文句子
The US has the largest recoverable shale-gas reserves and the second-largest recoverable shale-oil reserves in the world.	我是中文句子
Growth in shale energy will mean more investment, production, and jobs in the energy sector itself.	我是中文句子
Lower gas prices will boost manufacturing production, particularly in downstream industries like petrochemicals and primary metals that use natural gas as fuel and feedstock.	我是中文句子
But extracting shale energy involves environmental risks and uncertainties, among them groundwater contamination, higher methane emissions, and potential seismic effects.	我是中文句子
More research on the environmental risks and benefits of shale energy, and the development of new standards and regulations to control these risks are required.	我是中文句子
Big data and advanced analytics are another technology-driven game changer for US growth.	我是中文句子
As more data are generated, stored, and transmitted in digital form, new data sets relevant to personal and business decisions are growing exponentially.	我是中文句子
The potential savings in health-care costs would ease pressures on government budgets and release resources to boost growth in the rest of the economy.	我是中文句子
New information and communications technologies were game changers that boosted the potential growth rate of the US economy in the 1990’s.	我是中文句子
America’s Opposing Futures	我是中文句子
International finance economists see a financial crisis as likely, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the United States.	我是中文句子
When they cease their large-scale dollar-purchase programs, the value of the dollar will fall – and it will fall hard.	我是中文句子
International finance economists see a far bleaker future.	我是中文句子
When international finance economists sketch this scenario, domestically oriented macroeconomists respond that it sounds like a case of incompetent monetary policy.	我是中文句子
Why should the Federal Reserve allow long-term interest rates to spike just because other central banks have ceased their dollar-purchase programs?	我是中文句子
Should not the Fed step in and replace them with its own purchases of long-term US Treasury bonds, thereby keeping long-term interest rates at a level conducive to full employment?	我是中文句子
To this, international finance economists respond that the Fed does not have the power to do so.	我是中文句子
Serious economists whom I respect enormously find themselves taking strong positions on opposite sides of this debate.	我是中文句子
I’m not wise enough to say which side is right, but I certainly know which side I hope is wrong.	我是中文句子
America’s Other 30%	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – The American consumer is but a shadow of its former almighty self.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, it continues a pattern of weakness that has been evident since early 2008.	我是中文句子
Never before has the American consumer been this weak for this long.	我是中文句子
The cause is no secret.	我是中文句子
Consumers made huge bets on two bubbles – housing and credit.	我是中文句子
At the same time, sharply elevated unemployment and subpar income growth have combined to tighten the noose on over-extended consumers.	我是中文句子
As a result, American households have hunkered down as never before.	我是中文句子
Consumers are diverting what little income they earn away from spending toward paying down debt and rebuilding savings.	我是中文句子
That is both logical and rational – and thus not something that the US Federal Reserve can offset with unconventional monetary easing.	我是中文句子
American consumers’ unprecedented retrenchment has turned the US economy’s growth calculus inside out.	我是中文句子
Consumption typically accounts for 70% of GDP (71% in the second quarter, to be precise).	我是中文句子
But the 70% is barely growing, and is unlikely to expand strongly at any point in the foreseeable future.	我是中文句子
That puts an enormous burden on the other 30% of the US economy to generate any sort of recovery.	我是中文句子
In fact, the other 30% has not done a bad job, especially considering the severe headwinds coming from consumers’ 70%.	我是中文句子
The 30% mainly consists of four components – capital spending by firms, net exports (exports less imports), residential construction, and government purchases.	我是中文句子
Credit that mainly to the other 30%, especially to strong exports and a rebound in business capital spending.	我是中文句子
The housing sector has started to recover over the past five quarters, but from such a severely depressed level that its growth has had little impact on the overall economy.	我是中文句子
Given the strong likelihood that consumers will remain weak for years to come, America’s growth agenda needs to focus on getting more out of the other 30%.	我是中文句子
Of the four growth components that fall into this category, two have the greatest potential to make a difference – capital spending and exports.	我是中文句子
Prospects for these two sources of growth will not only influence the vigor, or lack thereof, of any recovery; they could well be decisive in bringing about an important shift in the US growth model.	我是中文句子
Capital spending and exports, which together account for about 24% of GDP, hold the key to this shift.	我是中文句子
At just over 10% of GDP, the share of capital spending is well below the peak of nearly 13% in 2000.	我是中文句子
Only then could export growth, impressive since mid-2009, sustain further increases.	我是中文句子
And only then could the US stem the rising tide of import penetration by foreign producers.	我是中文句子
The other 30% is also emblematic of a deeper strategic issue that America faces – a profound competitive challenge.	我是中文句子
A shift to external demand is not there for the asking. It must be earned by hard work, sheer determination, and a long overdue competitive revival.	我是中文句子
On that front, too, America has been falling behind.	我是中文句子
The erosion is traceable to several factors, including deficiencies in primary and secondary education as well as poor macroeconomic management.	我是中文句子
Improvement on all counts is vital for America’s competitive revival.	我是中文句子
But meeting the challenge will require vigorous growth from America’s other 30% – especially private capital spending.	我是中文句子
With the American consumer likely to remain on ice, the same 30% must also continue to shoulder the burden of a sluggish economic recovery.	我是中文句子
None of this can occur in a vacuum.	我是中文句子
The investment required for competitive revival and sustained recovery cannot be funded without a long-overdue improvement in US saving.	我是中文句子
In an era of outsize government deficits and subpar household saving, that may be America’s toughest challenge of all.	我是中文句子
America's Other 87 Deficits	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – The United States has a classic multilateral trade imbalance.	我是中文句子
While it runs a large trade deficit with China, it also runs deficits with 87 other countries.	我是中文句子
A multilateral deficit cannot be fixed by putting pressure on one of its bilateral components.	我是中文句子
But try telling that to America’s growing chorus of China bashers.	我是中文句子
America’s massive trade deficit is a direct consequence of an unprecedented shortfall of domestic saving.	我是中文句子
It is measured in “net” terms to strip out the depreciation associated with aging or obsolescent capacity.	我是中文句子
It provides a measure of the saving that is available to fund expansion of a country’s capital stock, and thus to sustain its economic growth.	我是中文句子
In the US, there simply is no net saving any more.	我是中文句子
Never before in modern history has the world’s leading economic power experienced a saving shortfall of such epic proportions.	我是中文句子
Yet the US found a way to finesse this problem.	我是中文句子
This gap has narrowed in the past couple of years, but much of the improvement probably reflects little more than the temporary impact of an unusually tough business cycle.	我是中文句子
This is where America’s multilateral trade deficit enters the equation, for it has long accounted for the bulk of America’s balance-of-payments gap.	我是中文句子
Since 2000, it has made up fully 96% of the cumulative current-account shortfall.	我是中文句子
And that is what ultimately makes the China-centric blame game so absurd.	我是中文句子
Yet that is exactly what US officials, together with many prominent economists, believe America needs.	我是中文句子
Yes, China does account for the largest component of America’s multilateral trade deficit – making up 42% of the total trade gap in 2010.	我是中文句子
Conscious outsourcing and supply-chain management decisions by US multinationals play an important role in exaggerating China’s share.	我是中文句子
But that does little to let China off the hook in the eyes of Washington.	我是中文句子
That was precisely the argument behind the US Senate’s recent overwhelming approval of a “currency bill” that took dead aim on China.	我是中文句子
While it may be convenient to hold others accountable for America’s problems, this is bad economics driving bad politics.	我是中文句子
In that vein, closing down trade with China, while failing to address the saving shortfall, is like putting pressure on one end of a water balloon.	我是中文句子
The Chinese component of America’s multilateral trade deficit will simply migrate somewhere else – most likely to a higher-cost producer.	我是中文句子
That would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on beleaguered American families – hardly the solution that US politicians are promising.	我是中文句子
This is not to ignore important US-China trade issues that need to be addressed.	我是中文句子
Market access should be high on the agenda – especially for a sluggish US economy that needs new sources of growth, like exports.	我是中文句子
China should be viewed as an opportunity, not a threat.	我是中文句子
At the same time, the US government should come clean with the American public about charges of Chinese currency manipulation and unfair trade practices.	我是中文句子
The renminbi has, in fact, appreciated by 30% relative to the US dollar since mid-2005.	我是中文句子
Yes, China continues to accumulate a vast fund of foreign-exchange reserves.	我是中文句子
China-bashing in the US speaks to a corrosive shift in the American psyche.	我是中文句子
It deflects attention away from those truly responsible for perpetuating the greatest saving shortfall in history.	我是中文句子
Washington has been seduced by the political economy of false prosperity.	我是中文句子
That seduction has encouraged America to squander its savings and live beyond its means for nearly two decades.	我是中文句子
Now the game is up.	我是中文句子
The ultimate test of any nation’s character is to look inside itself at moments of great challenge. Swept up in the blame game, the US is doing the opposite.	我是中文句子
And that could well be the greatest tragedy of all.	我是中文句子
After all, America’s 88 deficits did not arise of thin air.	我是中文句子
The American Consumer is Not Okay	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – The spin-doctors are hard at work talking up America’s subpar economic recovery.	我是中文句子
All eyes are on households.	我是中文句子
Don’t believe it.	我是中文句子
Look no further for the cause of unacceptably high US unemployment.	我是中文句子
To appreciate fully the unique character of this consumer-demand shortfall, trends over the past 21 quarters need to be broken down into two distinct sub-periods.	我是中文句子
First, there was a 2.2% annualized decline from the first quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009.	我是中文句子
This was crisis-driven carnage, highlighted by a 4.5% annualized collapse in the final two quarters of 2008.	我是中文句子
That key point appears all but lost on the consumer-recovery crowd.	我是中文句子
At least it’s a recovery, they claim, and a sign of healing that can be attributed mainly to the heroic, unconventional efforts of the US Federal Reserve.	我是中文句子
This brings us to the second part of the argument against optimism: analytics.	我是中文句子
One of the first concepts to which an economics student is exposed in a basic macro course is “pent-up” consumer demand.	我是中文句子
Discretionary consumption is typically deferred during recessions, especially for long-lasting durable goods such as motor vehicles, furniture, and appliances.	我是中文句子
Once the recession ends and recovery begins, a “stock-adjustment” response takes hold, as households compensate for foregone replacement and update their aging durable goods.	我是中文句子
Over most of the postwar period, this post-recession release of pent-up consumer demand has been a powerful source of support for economic recovery.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the strongest quarterly gain was a 4.1% increase in the fourth quarter of 2010.	我是中文句子
This is a stunning result.	我是中文句子
Yet it did anything but that.	我是中文句子
Instead, the release of pent-up consumer demand was literally half that of previous business cycles.	我是中文句子
The third point is more diagnostic: The shockingly anemic pattern of post-crisis US consumer demand has resulted from a deep Japan-like balance-sheet recession.	我是中文句子
When those bubbles burst, consumers were left with a massive overhang of excess debt and subpar saving.	我是中文句子
Through its unconventional monetary easing, the Fed is attempting to create a shortcut around the imperative of household sector balance-sheet repair.	我是中文句子
This is where the wealth effects of now-rebounding housing prices and a surging stock market come into play.	我是中文句子
But are these newfound wealth effects really all that they are made out to be?	我是中文句子
Yes, the stock market is now at an all-time high – but only in current dollars.	我是中文句子
In real terms, the S&P 500 is still 20% below its January 2000 peak.	我是中文句子
Wealth creation matters, but not until it recoups the wealth destruction that preceded it.	我是中文句子
Sadly, most American households are still far from recovery on the asset side of their balance sheets.	我是中文句子
At the same time, while consumer confidence is on the mend, it remains well below pre-crisis readings.	我是中文句子
In short, the American consumer’s nightmare is far from over.	我是中文句子
Spin and frothy markets aside, the healing has only just begun.	我是中文句子
America’s Political Recession	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – The odds are now about 36% that the United States will be in a recession next year.	我是中文句子
More than a century ago, during the first Gilded Age, American politics was sharply polarized as well.	我是中文句子
In 1896, future President Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican attack dog.	我是中文句子
The “free coinage of silver” would be “but a step towards the general socialism which is the fundamental doctrine of his political belief.”	我是中文句子
He and Altgeld “seek to overturn the...essential policies which have controlled the government since its foundation.”	我是中文句子
But neither Perry nor Kobach is likely ever to be a US president, whereas Theodore Roosevelt was more than a partisan.	我是中文句子
And yet he has gotten next to no Republicans to support their own policies.	我是中文句子
Likewise, he has been unable to get Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Paul Ryan to endorse his own Medicare cost-control proposals.	我是中文句子
There are obvious reasons for this.	我是中文句子
And the Republican cadres believe this of Obama even more than they believed it of Clinton.	我是中文句子
This view clearly influences Republican office-holders, who fear the partisan beast that mans their campaigns’ phone banks and holds the purse strings.	我是中文句子
That was the Republicans’ calculation in 2011-2012.	我是中文句子
But don’t count on it.	我是中文句子
But they are telling their favorites this because they think that pessimism now will lead to their being blamed for gridlock later.	我是中文句子
It seems to me that the odds are around 60% that real negotiation will not begin until tax rates go up on January 1.	我是中文句子
And it seems to me that, if gridlock continues into 2013, the odds are 60% that it will tip the US back into recession.	我是中文句子
Let us hope that it will be short and shallow.	我是中文句子
Bye-Bye, Middle East?	我是中文句子
This view seems intuitively correct, but is it?	我是中文句子
Energy-hungry America has long depended on the global market to meet domestic demand.	我是中文句子
In 2005, the US imported 60% of the energy that it consumed.	我是中文句子
Since then, however, the share of imports has decreased, and it should continue to do so.	我是中文句子
The US is expected to become energy self-sufficient in 2020, and to become an oil exporter by 2030.	我是中文句子
This scenario would grant the US three enormous advantages.	我是中文句子
It would enhance US economic competitiveness, especially relative to Europe, given the lower costs involved in the extraction of shale gas.	我是中文句子
It would also reduce America’s exposure to growing unrest in the Arab world.	我是中文句子
Finally, it would increase the relative vulnerability of America’s main strategic rival, China, which is becoming increasingly dependent on Middle East energy supplies.	我是中文句子
These facts obviously need to be taken seriously, but their implications for US foreign policy in the Middle East should not be too hastily drawn.	我是中文句子
Above all, though energy dependence is a key element of US policy in the region, it is far from being the only factor.	我是中文句子
Israel’s security and the desire to contain Iran are equally important.	我是中文句子
Within the next 15 years, OPEC countries will account for 50% of global oil production, compared to only 42% today.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, the country on which this increase will most likely hinge is Iraq.	我是中文句子
Would it withdraw in the face of the consequent strategic threat to its three allies – Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel – in the region?	我是中文句子
Even when its energy dependence on the Middle East was at its peak, the US rarely altered its policy of support for Israel.	我是中文句子
In the end, America’s position in the region strengthened after Egypt became a US ally and made peace with Israel.	我是中文句子
China’s growing interest in the Middle East also decreases the likelihood of an American withdrawal.	我是中文句子
The US will remain concerned about ensuring the security of energy supplies for its Asian allies, which, like China, are increasingly dependent on the region’s oil exporters.	我是中文句子
Its involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will likely be limited to maintaining the status quo rather than seeking a comprehensive settlement.	我是中文句子
That would certainly satisfy Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian fringe seeking to weaken the Palestinian Authority.	我是中文句子
But it would fully vindicate those who believe that Obama is more a man of good will than a visionary.	我是中文句子
America’s Perpetual Christmas	我是中文句子
Has the United States transcended the laws of economics?	我是中文句子
As the New Year begins, the US continues to race ahead of its rich-country counterparts.	我是中文句子
The gargantuan US trade deficit?	我是中文句子
No problem.	我是中文句子
In 2005, it widened further, and the dollar only strengthened.	我是中文句子
Low investment and a deteriorating primary education system?	我是中文句子
Not to worry.	我是中文句子
The super-flexible US economy keeps managing to produce more with less.	我是中文句子
Nor are there any signs of America’s economic hegemony starting to fold under the weight of maintaining its unilateral military dominance.	我是中文句子
There are those who truly believe in the idea that America is exceptional.	我是中文句子
Those true believers argue that America’s consumers can long pursue their spendthrift ways because their country’s economy is better than everyone else’s.	我是中文句子
The US labor market is more flexible than Europe’s, enabling it to react more nimbly to the ever shifting sands of globalization.	我是中文句子
And, unlike most countries, especially in Latin America and Asia, the US system ruthlessly prunes weak corporate leadership.	我是中文句子
On top of all this, the US military, rather than being a burden, feeds the country’s technological superiority by subsidizing basic research.	我是中文句子
By contrast, skeptics hold that the US economy already contains the seeds of its own socio-economic decline.	我是中文句子
Poor children do not have reasonable access to health care.	我是中文句子
Nor are the non-poor faring particularly well, as wage growth has remained virtually flat for a very long time, even as corporate profits are booming.	我是中文句子
All of these factors place deep stresses on the social fabric which, so the skeptics argue, will ultimately play out in the political arena.	我是中文句子
So which is it?	我是中文句子
In my view, those who think that America is about to collapse are likely to be disappointed.	我是中文句子
Nevertheless, I suspect that the age of American exceptionalism is near an end, and soon per capita income in Europe and Japan will approach that of the US, rather than falling farther behind.	我是中文句子
The last 15 years have of course revealed deep flaws in Japan’s financial system.	我是中文句子
But another major factor contributing to Japan’s decline was that firms elsewhere began adopting Japanese methods, such as just-in-time supply chains.	我是中文句子
Surely, imitation will someday impinge on superior US growth performance as well.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the biggest weakness in the true believers’ argument is the trade deficit.	我是中文句子
At some point, the party is going to end.	我是中文句子
Individually, these are each highly plausible scenarios, and collectively they would hit the US trade deficit like a perfect storm.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the end will come in a different way, but it is difficult to imagine the age of US exceptionalism lasting indefinitely.	我是中文句子
Can the end come abruptly in 2006?	我是中文句子
This is not the most likely scenario, but it is not unthinkable.	我是中文句子
America’s Strategy Vacuum	我是中文句子
NEW HAVEN – Apparently, policymakers at the Federal Reserve are having second thoughts about the wisdom of open-ended quantitative easing (QE).	我是中文句子
They should.	我是中文句子
Not only has this untested policy experiment failed to deliver an acceptable economic recovery; it has also heightened the risk of another crisis.	我是中文句子
That approach might have worked had the US economy been afflicted by a cyclical disease – a temporary shortfall of aggregate demand.	我是中文句子
In that case, countercyclical policies – both fiscal and monetary – could eventually be expected to plug the demand hole and get the economy going again, just as Keynesians argue.	我是中文句子
Two bubbles – property and credit – against which American families borrowed freely, have long since burst.	我是中文句子
Understandably fixated on balance-sheet repair, US consumers have not taken the bait from their monetary and fiscal authorities.	我是中文句子
Instead, they have cut back on spending.	我是中文句子
The brute force of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus rings hollow as a cyclical remedy to this problem.	我是中文句子
Another approach is needed.	我是中文句子
The focus, instead, should be on accelerating the process of balance-sheet repair, while at the same time returning monetary and fiscal policy levers to more normal settings.	我是中文句子
How else can the crisis-battered housing market finally clear for the remainder of US homeowners?	我是中文句子
The same can be said for enhanced saving incentives, which would contribute to longer-term financial security for American households, most of which suffered massive wealth losses in the Great Recession.	我是中文句子
Yes, these are controversial policies.	我是中文句子
Debt forgiveness raises thorny ethical concerns about condoning reckless and irresponsible behavior.	我是中文句子
Timing is also an issue, especially with respect to saving incentives.	我是中文句子
To avoid the shortfall in aggregate demand that might arise from an abrupt surge in saving, these measures should be phased in over a period of 3-5 years.	我是中文句子
As the quintessential laissez-faire system, the US has outsourced strategy to the invisible hand of the market for far too long.	我是中文句子
That has left the government locked into a reactive and often misguided approach to unexpected problems.	我是中文句子
Thus, the Fed is focused on cleaning up after a crisis rather than on how to avoid another one.	我是中文句子
A compliant bond market, which may well be the next bubble, is mistakenly viewed as the ultimate validation of this myopic approach.	我是中文句子
The dangers of America’s strategy vacuum and the related penchant for short-termism have been mounting for some time.	我是中文句子
Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter famously raised this concern in a 1996 article in the Harvard Business Review.	我是中文句子
While Porter’s critique was directed at business managers, it bears critically on the current US policy debate.	我是中文句子
A successful long-term strategy cannot be seen as a succession of short-term fixes.	我是中文句子
A comparable debate is raging over fiscal policy.	我是中文句子
Can America finally face up to the perils of its strategy vacuum?	我是中文句子
America’s Political Class Struggle	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – America is on a collision course with itself.	我是中文句子
As in many countries, conflicts over public morality and national strategy come down to questions of money. In the United States, this is truer than ever.	我是中文句子
The US is running an annual budget deficit of around $1 trillion, which may widen further as a result of the new tax agreement.	我是中文句子
This level of annual borrowing is far too high for comfort. It must be cut, but how?	我是中文句子
The problem is America’s corrupted politics and loss of civic morality.	我是中文句子
One political party, the Republicans, stands for little except tax cuts, which they place above any other goal.	我是中文句子
The Democrats have a bit wider set of interests, including support for health care, education, training, and infrastructure.	我是中文句子
The result is a dangerous paradox.	我是中文句子
The US budget deficit is enormous and unsustainable.	我是中文句子
The poor are squeezed by cuts in social programs and a weak job market.	我是中文句子
One in eight Americans depends on Food Stamps to eat.	我是中文句子
This tax-cutting frenzy comes, incredibly, after three decades of elite fiscal rule in the US that has favored the rich and powerful.	我是中文句子
Amazingly, the richest 1% of American households now has a higher net worth than the bottom 90%.	我是中文句子
The annual income of the richest 12,000 households is greater than that of the poorest 24 million households.	我是中文句子
The Republican Party’s real game is to try to lock that income and wealth advantage into place.	我是中文句子
They fear, rightly, that sooner or later everyone else will begin demanding that the budget deficit be closed in part by raising taxes on the rich.	我是中文句子
After all, the rich are living better than ever, while the rest of American society is suffering.	我是中文句子
It makes sense to tax them more.	我是中文句子
The Republicans are out to prevent that by any means.	我是中文句子
This month, they succeeded, at least for now.	我是中文句子
Their leaders in Congress are already declaring that they will slash public spending in order to begin reducing the deficit.	我是中文句子
Ironically, there is one area in which large budget cuts are certainly warranted: the military.	我是中文句子
But that is the one item most Republicans won’t touch.	我是中文句子
In the end, I don’t think they will succeed.	我是中文句子
For the moment, most Americans seem to be going along with Republican arguments that it is better to close the budget deficit through spending cuts rather than tax increases.	我是中文句子
Yet when the actual budget proposals are made, there will be a growing backlash.	我是中文句子
With their backs against the wall, I predict, poor and working-class Americans will begin to agitate for social justice.	我是中文句子
This may take time.	我是中文句子
The level of political corruption in America is staggering.	我是中文句子
Everything now is about money to run electoral campaigns, which have become incredibly expensive.	我是中文句子
The mid-term elections cost an estimated $4.5 billion, with most of the contributions coming from big corporations and rich contributors.	我是中文句子
But make no mistake: both parties are implicated.	我是中文句子
There is already talk that Obama will raise $1 billion or more for his re-election campaign.	我是中文句子
That sum will not come from the poor.	我是中文句子
Will America really let its public infrastructure continue to deteriorate?	我是中文句子
The rich will try to push such an agenda, but ultimately they will fail.	我是中文句子
Obama swept to power on the promise of change.	我是中文句子
So far there has been none.	我是中文句子
His administration is filled with Wall Street bankers.	我是中文句子
His top officials leave to join the banks, as his budget director Peter Orszag recently did.	我是中文句子
He is always ready to serve the interests of the rich and powerful, with no line in the sand, no limit to “compromise.”	我是中文句子
If this continues, a third party will emerge, committed to cleaning up American politics and restoring a measure of decency and fairness.	我是中文句子
This, too, will take time.	我是中文句子
The political system is deeply skewed against challenges to the two incumbent parties.	我是中文句子
Yet the time for change will come.	我是中文句子
America's Problems Run Deeper than Wall Street	我是中文句子
What started as a problem with sub-prime mortgages has now spread to houses more generally, as well as to other asset classes.	我是中文句子
The housing problem is contributing to the financial crisis, which in turn is reducing the supply of credit needed to sustain economic activity.	我是中文句子
Negative equity is significant because mortgages in the United States are generally “no recourse” loans.	我是中文句子
If a homeowner defaults, creditors can take the house, but they cannot take other property or income to make up any unpaid balance.	我是中文句子
Even in those states where mortgages are not “no recourse” loans, creditors generally do not pursue the assets or income of individuals who default.	我是中文句子
We cannot be sure about how much further house prices will fall.	我是中文句子
Experts say another 15% decline is required just to return to the pre-bubble price path.	我是中文句子
But there is nothing to stop the decline from continuing once it reaches that point.	我是中文句子
The growing gap between mortgage debts and house prices will continue to increase the rate of defaults.	我是中文句子
Many homeowners who can afford to make their mortgage payments will choose to default, move to rental housing, and wait to purchase until house prices have declined further.	我是中文句子
As homeowners with large negative equity default, the foreclosed homes contribute to the excess supply that drives prices down further.	我是中文句子
And the lower prices lead to more negative equity and therefore to more defaults and foreclosures.	我是中文句子
It is not clear what will stop this self-reinforcing process.	我是中文句子
Until house prices stabilize, these securities cannot be valued with any confidence.	我是中文句子
Without this confidence, credit will not flow and economic activity will be constrained.	我是中文句子
Moreover, because financial institutions’ assets were bought mainly with borrowed money, the shortage of credit is exacerbated by their need to deleverage.	我是中文句子
Since raising capital is difficult and costly, they deleverage by lending less.	我是中文句子
But the macroeconomic weakness in the US now goes beyond the decreased supply of credit.  Falling house prices reduce household wealth and therefore consumer spending.	我是中文句子
Falling employment lowers wage and salary incomes.	我是中文句子
The higher prices of food and energy depress real incomes further.	我是中文句子
And declining economic activity in the rest of the world is lowering demand for US exports.	我是中文句子
The US Federal Reserve has, in my judgment, responded appropriately by reducing the federal funds interest rate sharply and creating a variety of new credit facilities.	我是中文句子
The US Congress and the Bush administration enacted a $100 billion tax rebate in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending.	我是中文句子
Our support was, in the words of Samuel Johnson, a triumph of hope over experience.	我是中文句子
In the end, our hopes were frustrated.	我是中文句子
The official national income accounting data for the second quarter are now available, and they show that the rebates did very little to stimulate spending.	我是中文句子
More than 80% of the rebate dollars were saved or used to pay down debt.	我是中文句子
Very little was added to current spending.	我是中文句子
That is an unenviable situation, to say the least, for any incoming president.	我是中文句子
Obama’s Burmese Gamble	我是中文句子
ARLINGTON – The rapprochement between the United States and Myanmar (Burma) has proceeded at a blistering pace.	我是中文句子
A year ago, the two countries did not even have ambassadors in each other’s capitals.	我是中文句子
In May, President Thein Sein became the first leader from Myanmar to visit the White House in nearly a half-century.	我是中文句子
But has Barack Obama’s administration been too quick to embrace what was, until recently, one of the world’s most repressive regimes?	我是中文句子
Or, on the contrary, is decisive US support essential to Myanmar’s fledgling reform process?	我是中文句子
Until the recent opening, Myanmar, which gained independence in 1948, had been ruled by a secretive military junta since 1962.	我是中文句子
As recently as 2010, the regime held elections so blatantly rigged that the main opposition party refused to participate.	我是中文句子
Unlike the token gestures of reform offered by previous rulers, Sein’s actions appeared substantive and meaningful.	我是中文句子
One important change was the release of hundreds of political prisoners, including the regime’s most prominent opponent, Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been under house arrest for nearly 15 years.	我是中文句子
The subsequent elections bolstered hope for Myanmar’s democratic future.	我是中文句子
In 1990, when the NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, the junta promptly voided the results and arrested Suu Kyi.	我是中文句子
In 2012, the NLD won 43 of the 44 seats that it contested, and the military accepted Suu Kyi as the reform movement’s legitimate leader.	我是中文句子
But, in some areas, reform has been painfully slow.	我是中文句子
In fact, when it comes to human rights and minority protections, Myanmar may even be regressing.	我是中文句子
The liberalization process has exposed the country’s long-standing religious divisions, leading to a wave of sectarian violence aimed primarily at the minority Muslim community.	我是中文句子
At his meeting with Sein in Washington, DC, Obama condemned the violence against Myanmar’s Muslims, which has displaced many of them.	我是中文句子
On the same day, the US State Department released its annual report on religious freedom, in which Myanmar was included among the world’s eight worst offenders.	我是中文句子
This has not always been the case.	我是中文句子
Although Myanmar is an overwhelmingly Buddhist country, dozens of religious and ethnic communities have long lived there side by side.	我是中文句子
Muslims need to be assured of their personal security and guaranteed full civil rights.	我是中文句子
The Obama administration has staked significant political capital on the wager that Myanmar’s promise may finally bear fruit.	我是中文句子
And, indeed, the rate of change in Myanmar over the last two years has been nothing short of remarkable.	我是中文句子
But, as Sein acknowledged at the White House, Myanmar’s government “has been encountering obstacles and challenges along [its] democratization process.”	我是中文句子
How it copes with these problems – and those that have yet to arise – will determine whether America has given its blessing prematurely.	我是中文句子
America's Renminbi Fixation	我是中文句子
The upcoming Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the US and China is an excellent opportunity to examine – and rethink – America’s priorities.	我是中文句子
The Chinese, insists a broad coalition of politicians, business leaders, and academic economists, must revalue or face sanctions.	我是中文句子
This reasoning resonates with the US public.	我是中文句子
Opinion polls conducted in 2011 found that fully 61% of Americans believes that China represents a serious economic threat.	我是中文句子
As such, the currency debate looms as a major issue in the upcoming US presidential campaign.	我是中文句子
“Enough is enough,” President Barack Obama replied, when queried on the renminbi in the aftermath of his last meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao.	我是中文句子
But, however appealing this logic may be, it is wrong.	我是中文句子
First, America’s trade deficit is multilateral: the US ran deficits with 88 nations in 2010.	我是中文句子
A multilateral imbalance – especially one that it is traceable to a saving shortfall – cannot be fixed by putting pressure on a bilateral exchange rate.	我是中文句子
Indeed, America’s major threat is from within.	我是中文句子
Third, there has been significant improvement in China’s external imbalance.	我是中文句子
American officials have long bemoaned China’s saving glut as a major source of global instability.	我是中文句子
But they should look in the mirror: America’s current-account deficit this year, at an estimated $510 billion, is likely to be 2.8 times higher than China’s surplus.	我是中文句子
Finally, China has evolved from the world’s factory to its assembly line.	我是中文句子
Research shows that no more than 20% to 30% of Chinese exports to the US reflect value added inside China.	我是中文句子
Roughly 60% of Chinese exports represent shipments of “foreign invested enterprises” – in effect, Chinese subsidiaries of global multinationals.	我是中文句子
Think Apple.	我是中文句子
Globalized production platforms distort bilateral trade data between the US and China, and have little to do with the exchange rate.	我是中文句子
Rather than vilifying China as the principal economic threat to America, the relationship should be recast as an opportunity.	我是中文句子
The largest component of US aggregate demand – the consumer – is on ice.	我是中文句子
Consumer deleveraging is likely to persist for years to come, leaving the US increasingly desperate for new sources of growth.	我是中文句子
Exports top the list of possibilities.	我是中文句子
China is now America’s third largest and most rapidly growing export market.	我是中文句子
There can be no mistaking its potential to fill some of the void left by US consumers.	我是中文句子
The key to realizing that opportunity lies in access to Chinese markets – all the more significant in light of China’s upcoming pro-consumption rebalancing.	我是中文句子
As a result, for a given increment of domestic demand, China is far more predisposed toward foreign sourcing.	我是中文句子
The same is true of services.	我是中文句子
At just 43% of GDP, China’s services sector is relatively tiny.	我是中文句子
Some progress has been made, but more is needed – for example, getting China to join the World Trade Organization’s Government Procurement Agreement.	我是中文句子
At the same time, the US should reconsider antiquated Cold War restrictions on Chinese purchases of technology-intensive items.	我是中文句子
For a growth-starved US, the opportunities of market access far outweigh the currency threat.	我是中文句子
The long-dormant Chinese consumer is about to be unleashed.	我是中文句子
This plays to one of America’s greatest strengths – its zeal to compete in new markets.	我是中文句子
Shame on the US if it squanders this extraordinary chance by digging in its heels at the upcoming Strategic and Economic dialogue.	我是中文句子
America's Retreat from Asia	我是中文句子
But a key condition for a smooth redeployment of US troops is close consultations by America with its allies, something it has not done well up to now.	我是中文句子
South Korea and Japan need to have their views taken into serious account if this now inevitable withdrawal is to succeed.	我是中文句子
The withdrawal plan is causing countless worries.	我是中文句子
In Japan, there are concerns that it will make the country America's frontline command post in Asia, possibly beyond the scope of its bilateral security treaty with the US.	我是中文句子
One result is that China feels nervous about the implications of any expansion of the American-Japanese military partnership.	我是中文句子
But the impact of America's planned troop withdrawals is felt most keenly in South Korea.	我是中文句子
Indeed, it should not be forgotten that North Korea maintains an army of 1.1 million troops.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the manner in which the Bush administration unveiled its withdrawal plan has weakened the credibility of the US-Korean alliance.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the US plans to strengthen South Korea's own forces by supplying some $11 billion worth of high-technology equipment over the next five years.	我是中文句子
Militarily, this argument does make sense.	我是中文句子
Once they resolve to continue their alliance with these purposes in mind, it should be possible for responsible officials to work out guiding principles for concrete security cooperation.	我是中文句子
Specific negotiations on withdrawing American troops from Korea or on redeploying them from the DMZ to south of Seoul must be carried out according to these principles.	我是中文句子
In so doing, America must treat South Korea as a full partner with its own voice in making decisions that affect its security interests.	我是中文句子
As an American ally for 51 years, and as East Asia's third-largest economy, South Korea is entitled to be fully consulted on such decisions.	我是中文句子
Despite anti-American sentiments among some South Koreans, a majority of the country's people wants American forces to remain as a stabilizing force.	我是中文句子
For this reason, America and South Korea must restore a strategic vision for the future.	我是中文句子
America's Schizophrenic Economy	我是中文句子
The news about America's economy that dribbled out over the first half of March painted - once again - a picture that only a schizophrenic could create.	我是中文句子
Real investment (investment adjusted for the declining prices of high-tech and information-related capital goods) continued to roar ahead.	我是中文句子
Production and sales were consistent with the consensus forecast of real GDP growth at an annual rate of 4% or more.	我是中文句子
Yet, despite all this, employment remained stagnant: net job creation in the United States continues to stall.	我是中文句子
This does not mean that employment in America cannot grow.	我是中文句子
Roughly 300,000 more Americans are employed in education and health care than a year ago - an annual rate of employment growth of 1.7%.	我是中文句子
A quarter of a million more Americans are employed in business and professional services than a year ago - a 1.6% annual rate of employment growth.	我是中文句子
This is easy to demonstrate.	我是中文句子
Total nominal spending in America grows at 5.5% per year. Inflation is 1.5% per year.	我是中文句子
And overall productivity growth is 3.5% per year.	我是中文句子
So the equation is simple: 5.5%-1.5%-3.5% = 0.5%.	我是中文句子
Where America's productivity growth is coming from is clear.	我是中文句子
The boost to wealth provided by the "new economy" is exceeding even its most avid boosters' wildest dreams.	我是中文句子
But why does this seem so surprising?	我是中文句子
For the US to have a rate of productivity growth of 3.5% per annum rather than the pre-1995 rate of 1.2% is amazing.	我是中文句子
That means an annual increment to world income of $250 billion from this source alone.	我是中文句子
That's the equivalent of adding productive power equal to a quarter of the economy of India - and adding it every year.	我是中文句子
This persistent acceleration in American productivity growth has, however, created a massive political problem for President George W. Bush.	我是中文句子
But for everyone except Bush - and those left unemployed by the lag in demand - it is an extraordinary opportunity.	我是中文句子
America’s Scorched Earth Management	我是中文句子
Paradoxically, one indicator that has been improving steadily in the US – productivity – may be the clearest sign of the problem.	我是中文句子
Productivity is a measure of output per hour worked.	我是中文句子
So a company that fires all its workers and then ships from stock can look very productive – until it runs outs of stock.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, those employees left behind must work that much harder, often without increased compensation.	我是中文句子
Workers’ wages, adjusted for inflation, fell in 2007, continuing a trend throughout this decade.	我是中文句子
That, too, is “productive” – until these overworked people quit or burn out.	我是中文句子
A sustainable company is not a collection of “human resources.” It is a community of human beings.	我是中文句子
Its strength resides in its people, its culture, and the goodwill it has built up among its customers and suppliers.	我是中文句子
Consider high technology, where America is supposed to excel.	我是中文句子
This is not clothing or cars, but America’s largest, and most renowned, export sector.	我是中文句子
This deficit reflects an underlying research deficit.	我是中文句子
Of the 25 companies granted the most US patents in 2006, only eight were American; 12 were Japanese.	我是中文句子
As a result, many simply learned to manage their companies’ short-term share price at the expense of attention to their products and customers.	我是中文句子
This shift to “heroic” leadership can be seen in ballooning CEO compensation.	我是中文句子
But the bubble itself resulted from the same management pathologies as those afflicting the real economy.	我是中文句子
After all, managing for the short run encouraged mortgage lenders to offer artificially low “teaser” interest rates to lure potential homeowners.	我是中文句子
And then those who bought these mortgages never bothered to investigate their underlying value – a spectacular abdication of managerial responsibility.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, it may be possible to minimize the fallout for the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
As a result, other key economies remain healthier than America’s.	我是中文句子
Make no mistake: this problem was made in America, and that is where it will have to be solved.	我是中文句子
America’s Self-Defeating Hegemony	我是中文句子
To be sure, preemption is fully justified vis-à-vis stateless terrorists wielding such weapons.	我是中文句子
The second important miscalculation concerned the likely global reaction to America’s exercise of its hegemonic power.	我是中文句子
This is why the exercise of conventional power has become frustrating.	我是中文句子
Finally, the Bush administration’s use of power has lacked not only a compelling strategy or doctrine, but also simple competence.	我是中文句子
To this day, it has dropped the ball on very straightforward operational issues in Iraq, such as funding democracy promotion efforts.	我是中文句子
Incompetence in implementation has strategic consequences.	我是中文句子
Many of the voices that called for, and then bungled, military intervention in Iraq are now calling for war with Iran.	我是中文句子
Why should the rest of the world think that conflict with a larger and more resolute enemy would be handled any more capably?	我是中文句子
But the fundamental problem remains the lopsided distribution of power in the international system.	我是中文句子
Any country in the same position as the US, even a democracy, would be tempted to exercise its hegemonic power with less and less restraint.	我是中文句子
Such a system does not exist on a global scale today, which may explain how America got into such trouble.	我是中文句子
A smoother international distribution of power, even in a global system that is less than fully democratic, would pose fewer temptations to abandon the prudent exercise of power.	我是中文句子
America’s Self-Inflicted Decline	我是中文句子
MELBOURNE – If the broad post-World War II prosperity that has endured for six decades comes to an end, both the United States and Europe will be responsible.	我是中文句子
With rare exceptions, politics has become a discredited profession throughout the West.	我是中文句子
Tomorrow is always treated as more important than next week, and next week prevails over next year, with no one seeking to secure the long-term future.	我是中文句子
Now the West is paying the price.	我是中文句子
America’s current fiscal problems are rooted in a long period of unfunded spending.	我是中文句子
Bush’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the manner in which he conducted the “global war on terror” made matters much worse, contributing to a totally unsustainable situation.	我是中文句子
Indeed, Obama inherited an almost impossible legacy.	我是中文句子
In the weeks since the debt ceiling agreement, it has become increasingly clear that good government might be impossible in the US.	我是中文句子
The coming months of campaigning for the US presidency will be spent in petty brawling over what should be cut.	我是中文句子
In these circumstances, it is not surprising that financial markets have returned to extreme volatility.	我是中文句子
The expenditure cuts mandated by the outcome of the debt-ceiling debate will reduce economic activity, thereby undermining growth and making debt reduction even more difficult.	我是中文句子
America’s leadership in world affairs began to weaken with the unilateralism of Bush, and today’s economic problems are reinforcing this tendency.	我是中文句子
The alternative, as China has suggested, would be to develop a new reserve currency.	我是中文句子
These realities represent a power shift of a kind that we have not experienced in our lifetimes.	我是中文句子
The counter-argument – that any sell-off or failure by China to continue to buy US government securities would hurt China as much as America – is not valid.	我是中文句子
As each year passes, China’s markets expand worldwide, and its domestic market comes to represent a greater percentage of its own GDP.	我是中文句子
As a result, China will not need a strong dollar in the long term.	我是中文句子
Americans need to get their economic house in order before China loses its incentive to support the dollar.	我是中文句子
On several occasions in the post-WWII period, the US has learned with great pain that there are limits to the effective use of military power.	我是中文句子
American objectives could not be achieved in Vietnam.	我是中文句子
The outcome in Iraq will not be determined until the last American troops have been withdrawn.	我是中文句子
In Afghanistan, where withdrawal dates have already been set, it is difficult to believe that a cohesive unified state can be established.	我是中文句子
As the efficacy of military power is reduced, so the importance of economic power grows.	我是中文句子
Recognition of these central realities – and bipartisanship in addressing them – is critical for America’s future, and that of the West.	我是中文句子
America’s Socialism for the Rich	我是中文句子
With all the talk of “green shoots” of economic recovery, America’s banks are pushing back on efforts to regulate them.	我是中文句子
The old system worked well for the bankers (if not for their shareholders), so why should they embrace change?	我是中文句子
It has long been recognized that those America’s banks that are too big to fail are also too big to be managed.	我是中文句子
That is one reason that the performance of several of them has been so dismal.	我是中文句子
Because government provides deposit insurance, it plays a large role in restructuring (unlike other sectors).  Normally, when a bank fails, the government engineers a financial restructuring; if it has to put in money, it, of course, gains a stake in the future.	我是中文句子
If they take big bets and win, they walk away with the proceeds; if they fail, the government picks up the tab.	我是中文句子
This is not just theory; it is a lesson we learned, at great expense, during the Savings & Loan crisis of the 1980’s.	我是中文句子
In a financial restructuring, shareholders typically get wiped out, and bondholders become the new shareholders.	我是中文句子
Sometimes, the government must provide additional funds; sometimes it looks for a new investor to take over the failed bank.	我是中文句子
The Obama administration has, however, introduced a new concept: too big to be financially restructured.	我是中文句子
The administration argues that all hell would break loose if we tried to play by the usual rules with these big banks.	我是中文句子
Markets would panic. So, not only can’t we touch the bondholders, we can’t even touch the shareholders – even if most of the shares’ existing value merely reflects a bet on a government bailout.	我是中文句子
I think this judgment is wrong.	我是中文句子
I think the Obama administration has succumbed to political pressure and scare-mongering by the big banks.	我是中文句子
As a result, the administration has confused bailing out the bankers and their shareholders with bailing out the banks.	我是中文句子
The bondholders will gain from an orderly restructuring, and if the value of the assets is truly greater than the market (and outside analysts) believe, they will eventually reap the gains.	我是中文句子
The taxpayer has had to pony up billions, and has provided billions more in guarantees – bills that are likely to come due in the future.	我是中文句子
Rewriting the rules of the market economy – in a way that has benefited those that have caused so much pain to the entire global economy – is worse than financially costly.	我是中文句子
Tearing up the social contract is something that should not be done lightly.	我是中文句子
But this new form of ersatz capitalism, in which losses are socialized and profits privatized, is doomed to failure.	我是中文句子
Incentives are distorted.	我是中文句子
There is no market discipline.	我是中文句子
Some have called this new economic regime “socialism with American characteristics.”	我是中文句子
But socialism is concerned about ordinary individuals.	我是中文句子
By contrast, the United States has provided little help for the millions of Americans who are losing their homes.	我是中文句子
Workers who lose their jobs receive only 39 weeks of limited unemployment benefits, and are then left on their own.	我是中文句子
And, when they lose their jobs, most lose their health insurance, too.	我是中文句子
In truth, this is not socialism, but an extension of long standing corporate welfarism.	我是中文句子
The rich and powerful turn to the government to help them whenever they can, while needy individuals get little social protection.	我是中文句子
And, if we don’t break them up, then we have to severely limit what they do.	我是中文句子
They can’t be allowed to do what they did in the past – gamble at others’ expenses.	我是中文句子
This raises another problem with America’s too-big-to-fail, too-big-to-be-restructured banks: they are too politically powerful.	我是中文句子
Their lobbying efforts worked well, first to deregulate, and then to have taxpayers pay for the cleanup.	我是中文句子
Their hope is that it will work once again to keep them free to do as they please, regardless of the risks for taxpayers and the economy.	我是中文句子
We cannot afford to let that happen.	我是中文句子
America’s Sputnik Moment in Beijing	我是中文句子
Or it could be remembered as another “Sputnik moment,” when, as with the Soviet foray into outer space in 1957, the American people realized that the country had lost its footing and decided it was time for the United States to get its act together.	我是中文句子
There was no mistaking the power and symbolism of the opening ceremonies for the Beijing Olympic Games on August 8.	我是中文句子
It would be hard to imagine Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan accepting a similar relative position.	我是中文句子
At the very same time that Bush was waving from the stands, Russia was invading Georgia, America’s closest partner in the Caucasus.	我是中文句子
Russia’s message to other West-leaning countries in the former Soviet world was clear: America cannot protect you.	我是中文句子
Frighteningly, the Russians were likely correct.	我是中文句子
Neo-colonialism is returning to Africa, the global project of human rights is in retreat, and the world trade system is becoming far less open.	我是中文句子
Brutal dictators go unpunished because their interests are protected by large powers with stakes in their natural resources.	我是中文句子
Reversing this trend is not only in America’s interest, but also in the world’s interest.	我是中文句子
The Beijing Olympics could be remembered as a new “Sputnik moment” for the US, inspiring the country to meaningfully face the music of a changing world.	我是中文句子
But America can make it so only by recognizing the great challenges it faces and taking bold steps towards addressing them, at home and with allies abroad.	我是中文句子
America’s Perilous Pivot	我是中文句子
MADRID – The Pacific or the Middle East?	我是中文句子
For the United States, that is now the primary strategic question.	我是中文句子
The violence in Gaza, coming as President Barack Obama was meeting Asia’s leaders in Phnom Penh, perfectly encapsulates America’s dilemma.	我是中文句子
Of the two geopolitical focal points demanding America’s attention, one represents the future and the other the past.	我是中文句子
If the Iran crisis were to boil over, the pivot to Asia would no longer be America’s main foreign-policy priority.	我是中文句子
The question, therefore, is whether the US will find itself drawn into another war in a region on which it depends less and less for energy.	我是中文句子
Asia is, of course, experiencing rapid economic growth, but managing the region’s strong nationalist tensions calls for the creation of regional security structures, together with closer economic integration.	我是中文句子
Cultivating strategic trust between the twenty-first century’s leading powers will be fundamental to the international system’s harmonious functioning.	我是中文句子
But how can this be achieved?	我是中文句子
After the January 2013 Israeli elections, Iran will again move to the top of Obama’s foreign-policy agenda.	我是中文句子
Military intervention in Iran – which itself will be holding a presidential election in June – would incite not only regional, but global, instability.	我是中文句子
So China has a large strategic interest in working with the US to avoid a showdown.	我是中文句子
Beyond Iran, the volatile situation throughout the Middle East urgently demands solutions.	我是中文句子
The latest eruption of violent conflict between Hamas and Israel underscores the importance of reviving the peace process.	我是中文句子
US public opinion seems to confirm this.	我是中文句子
A recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs indicated that 67% of Americans believe that the Iraq war was not worthwhile.	我是中文句子
Both sides may believe that their best option – at least for now – is to negotiate.	我是中文句子
Peaceful resolution of the Iranian question would help the US to complete its shift toward Asia.	我是中文句子
China may not wish for that outcome, but its own vital interest in the security of Middle East energy supplies should compel it to cooperate.	我是中文句子
America’s Suicidal Statecraft	我是中文句子
Since its victory in the Cold War, America’s global hegemony has rested on three pillars: economic power, military might, and a vast capacity to export its popular culture.	我是中文句子
Even so, America remains by far the world’s most powerful country; its decline has more to do with its incompetent use of power than with the emergence of competitors.	我是中文句子
Consider the Middle East.	我是中文句子
In 2003, America went to war without its trans-Atlantic allies after manipulating false assertions.	我是中文句子
The result has been utter failure: military defeat and a severe degradation of America’s moral standing.	我是中文句子
Rather than undermining radical Islam, the US has legitimized it, in Iraq and beyond.	我是中文句子
Indeed, what will now shape the future of the region is not democracy, but the violent divide between Shiites and Sunnis that the Iraq war precipitated.	我是中文句子
It is this Muslim civil war that is allowing al-Qaeda to gain a larger pool of recruits.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the US is seen as practically complicit in inciting a monumental reversal of Islam’s fortunes, the Shia revival.	我是中文句子
Admittedly, violent Islamic fundamentalism has deeper roots in the fading promise of Arab nationalism.	我是中文句子
America’s biggest strategic blunder in the Middle East arguably concerns the emergence of Iranian power.	我是中文句子
Likewise, Iran’s nuclear program gained momentum thanks to its sense of impunity following the colossal failure in Iraq of America’s concept of “preventive war.”	我是中文句子
The calamitous US military experience in Iraq has left it strategically diminished.	我是中文句子
Iraq has now become God’s playground, and America can hope to achieve a modicum of stability there only with the help of other regional powers.	我是中文句子
Nevertheless, the US will remain the most influential external actor in the Middle East, for its failure is one of leadership, not of actual power.	我是中文句子
America’s Threat to Trans-Pacific Trade	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama announced this with nine Asian countries during his recent trip to the region.	我是中文句子
The TPP is being sold in the US to a compliant media and unsuspecting public as evidence of American leadership on trade.	我是中文句子
But the opposite is true, and it is important that those who care about the global trading system know what is happening.	我是中文句子
One hopes that this knowledge will trigger what I call the “Dracula effect”: expose that which would prefer to remain hidden to sunlight and it will shrivel up and die.	我是中文句子
The TPP is a testament to the ability of US industrial lobbies, Congress, and presidents to obfuscate public policy.	我是中文句子
That is why economists typically call them preferential-trade agreements (PTAs).	我是中文句子
Countries are, in principle, free to join the TPP.	我是中文句子
Japan and Canada have said they plan to do so.	我是中文句子
But a closer look reveals that China is not a part of this agenda.	我是中文句子
From the outset, the TPP’s supposed openness has been wholly misleading.	我是中文句子
Only then were bigger countries like Japan offered membership on a “take it or leave it” basis.	我是中文句子
American regionalism closer to home shows the US now trying to promote the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA).	我是中文句子
This was not acceptable to Brazil, the leading force behind the FTAA, which focuses exclusively on trade issues.	我是中文句子
Brazil’s former President Luiz Lula Inácio da Silva, one of the world’s great trade-union leaders, rejected the inclusion of labor standards in trade treaties and institutions.	我是中文句子
The result of US efforts in South America, therefore, has been to fragment the region into two blocs, and the same is likely to happen in Asia.	我是中文句子
Ever since the US realized that it had chosen the wrong region to be regional with, it has been trying to win a seat at the Asian table.	我是中文句子
Many Asian countries joined the TPP to “keep the US in the region” in the face of Chinese heavy-handedness.	我是中文句子
America’s design for Asian trade is inspired by the goal of containing China, and the TPP template effectively excludes it, owing to the non-trade-related conditions imposed by US lobbies.	我是中文句子
The only way that a Chinese merger with the TPP could gain credibility would be to make all non-trade-related provisions optional.	我是中文句子
Of course, the US lobbies would have none of it.	我是中文句子
America’s Three Deficits	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – This year began with a series of reports providing tantalizing evidence that economic recovery in the United States is strengthening.	我是中文句子
The pace of job creation has increased, indicators for manufacturing and services have improved, and consumption spending has been stronger than anticipated.	我是中文句子
But it is too early to celebrate.	我是中文句子
Although output is now higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2007, it remains far below what could be produced if labor and capacity were fully utilized.	我是中文句子
That gap – between actual and potential output – is estimated at more than 7% of GDP (more than $1 trillion).	我是中文句子
America’s jobs deficit is primarily the result of inadequate aggregate demand.	我是中文句子
Consumption, which accounts for about 70% of total spending, is constrained by high unemployment, weak wage gains, and a steep decline in home values and consumer wealth.	我是中文句子
The uptick in consumption in the last months of 2011 was financed by a decline in the household saving rate and a large increase in consumer credit.	我是中文句子
Neither of these trends is healthy or sustainable.	我是中文句子
And labor income is the most important component of household earnings, the major driver of consumption spending.	我是中文句子
Even before the Great Recession, American workers and households were in trouble.	我是中文句子
The rate of job growth between 2000 and 2007 slowed to only half its level in the three preceding decades.	我是中文句子
Productivity growth was strong, but far outpaced wage growth, and workers’ real hourly compensation declined, on average, even for those with a university education.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the 2002-2007 period was the only recovery on record during which the median family’s real income declined.	我是中文句子
By contrast, employment in middle-skill, white-collar, and blue-collar occupations fell, particularly in manufacturing.	我是中文句子
Three forces have driven the US labor market’s adverse structural changes:	我是中文句子
·         Global competition and the integration of labor markets through trade and outsourcing, which have eliminated jobs and depressed wages.	我是中文句子
·         America’s declining competitiveness as an attractive place to locate production and employment.	我是中文句子
Technological change and globalization have created similar labor-market challenges in other developed countries.	我是中文句子
But US policy choices are responsible for the erosion of America’s competitiveness.	我是中文句子
In particular, the US is underinvesting in three major areas that help countries to create and retain high-wage jobs: skills and training, infrastructure, and research and development.	我是中文句子
Spending in these areas accounts for less than 10% of US government spending, and this share has been declining over time.	我是中文句子
The US does indeed face a long-run fiscal deficit, largely the result of rising health-care costs and an aging population.	我是中文句子
These measures would provide insurance to the fragile recovery and add nothing to the long-run fiscal gap.	我是中文句子
So, how should the US economy’s jobs deficit, investment deficit, and long-run fiscal deficit be addressed?	我是中文句子
Indeed, enactment of such a package could bolster output and employment growth by easing investor concerns about future deficits and strengthening consumer and business confidence.	我是中文句子
Painful choices about how to close the long-run fiscal gap should be decided now and implemented promptly once the economy has recovered.	我是中文句子
But, for the next few years, the priorities of fiscal policy should be jobs, investment, and growth.	我是中文句子
America’s Ungovernable Budget	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The heart of any government is found in its budget.	我是中文句子
Politicians can make endless promises, but if the budget doesn’t add up, politics is little more than mere words.	我是中文句子
The United States is now caught in such a bind.	我是中文句子
In his recent State of the Union address, President Barack Obama painted a convincing picture of modern, twenty-first-century government.	我是中文句子
His Republican Party opponents complained that Obama’s proposals would bust the budget.	我是中文句子
But the truth is that both parties are hiding from the reality: without more taxes, a modern, competitive US economy is not possible.	我是中文句子
Obama rightly emphasized that competitiveness in the world today depends on an educated workforce and modern infrastructure.	我是中文句子
That is true for any country, but it is especially relevant for rich countries.	我是中文句子
America and Europe will keep their high living standards only by basing their competitiveness on advanced skills, cutting-edge technologies, and modern infrastructure.	我是中文句子
He spelled out a vision of future growth in which public and private investment would be complementary, mutually supportive pillars.	我是中文句子
Obama emphasized these themes for good reason.	我是中文句子
Unless the US steps up its investment in education, science, technology, and infrastructure, these adverse trends will continue.	我是中文句子
But Obama’s message lost touch with reality when he turned his attention to the budget deficit.	我是中文句子
Acknowledging that recent fiscal policies had put the US on an unsustainable trajectory of rising public debt, Obama said that moving towards budget balance was now essential for fiscal stability.	我是中文句子
So he called for a five-year freeze on what the US government calls “discretionary” civilian spending.	我是中文句子
After telling Americans how important government investment is for modern growth, he promised to freeze that spending for the next five years!	我是中文句子
Politicians often change their message from one speech to the next, but rarely contradict it so glaringly in the same speech.	我是中文句子
That contradiction highlights the sad and self-defeating nature of US budget policies over the past 25 years, and most likely in the years to come.	我是中文句子
On the one hand, the US government must invest more to promote economic competitiveness.	我是中文句子
On the other hand, US taxes are chronically too low to support the level of government investment that is needed.	我是中文句子
At nearly 10% of GDP, the deficit is resulting in a mountain of debt that threatens America’s future.	我是中文句子
Various tax cuts initiated by George W. Bush were set to expire at the end of 2010.	我是中文句子
Tax cuts for the richest Americans were part of the package.	我是中文句子
The truth of US politics today is simple.	我是中文句子
The key policy for the leaders of both political parties is tax cuts, especially for the rich.	我是中文句子
Both political parties, and the White House, would rather cut taxes than spend more on education, science and technology, and infrastructure.	我是中文句子
And the explanation is straightforward: the richest households fund political campaigns.	我是中文句子
Both parties therefore cater to their wishes.	我是中文句子
One budget area can and should be cut: military spending.	我是中文句子
The economic and social consequences of a generation of tax cutting are clear.	我是中文句子
For all of the Obama administration’s lofty rhetoric, his fiscal-policy proposals make no serious attempt to address these problems.	我是中文句子
To do so would require calling for higher taxes, and that – as George H. W. Bush learned in 1992 – is no way to get re-elected.	我是中文句子
America’s Unhinged “Pivot”	我是中文句子
NEW DELHI – President Barack Obama’s first foreign trip since winning a second term highlights Asia’s new centrality to America’s economy and security.	我是中文句子
One challenge is the need to arrest the erosion of America’s relative power, which in turn requires comprehensive domestic renewal, including fiscal consolidation.	我是中文句子
The US under Obama has increasingly ceded ground to China, a trend that admittedly began when the Bush administration became preoccupied with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.	我是中文句子
The proposed deployment of an additional 2,500 Marines in Australia is largely symbolic.	我是中文句子
That change has come as a relief to those in the region who fear being forced to choose between the US and China.	我是中文句子
In fact, the economic reorientation of the US “pivot” corrects a policy that had overemphasized the military component and put the US on a path toward conflict with China.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the US is emphasizing the importance of the East Asia Summit and ASEAN, whose summit overlaps with the EAS meeting in Phnom Penh that Obama will be attending.	我是中文句子
Similarly, the US has urged both China and Japan to resolve peacefully their dispute over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands.	我是中文句子
America’s main goal is to prevent the standoff from escalating to the point that it would be forced – against its own interests – to take Japan’s side.	我是中文句子
The correction in US policy actually extends even to terminology.	我是中文句子
American diplomats have now abandoned the term “pivot” altogether, owing to its military connotation, in favor of “rebalancing.”	我是中文句子
The US and the rest of Asia must not merely adjust to China; they must seek to shape a China that plays by the rules.	我是中文句子
America’s War-Torn Economy	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – Some say there are two issues in the coming American elections: the Iraq war and the economy.	我是中文句子
On days when the war seems to be going better than expected, and the economy worse, the economy eclipses the war; but neither is faring well.	我是中文句子
In some sense, there is only one issue, and that is the war, which has exacerbated America’s economic problems.	我是中文句子
And when the world’s largest economy is sick – and it is now very sick – the entire world suffers.	我是中文句子
It used to be thought that wars were good for the economy.	我是中文句子
After all, World War II is widely thought to have helped lift the global economy out of the Great Depression.	我是中文句子
This war, in particular, has not been good for the economy, for three reasons.	我是中文句子
First, it has contributed to rising oil prices.	我是中文句子
When the United States went to war, oil cost less than $25 a barrel, and futures markets expected it to remain there for a decade.	我是中文句子
Futures traders knew about the growth of China and other emerging markets; but they expected supply – mainly from low-cost Middle East providers – to increase in tandem with demand.	我是中文句子
The war changed that equation.	我是中文句子
Economists talk about “bang for the buck” – how much economic stimulus is provided by each dollar of spending.	我是中文句子
It’s hard to imagine less bang than from bucks spent on a Nepalese contractor working in Iraq.	我是中文句子
With so many dollars going abroad, the American economy should have been in a much weaker shape than it appeared.	我是中文句子
Now it has responded, with a stimulus package that is too little, too late, and badly designed.	我是中文句子
To see the inadequacy of that package, compare it with the more than $1.5 trillion that was borrowed in home equity loans in recent years, most of it spent on consumption.	我是中文句子
That game – based on a belief in ever-spiraling home prices – is over.	我是中文句子
So, while the additional liquidity injected into the financial system by the Fed may have prevented a meltdown, it won’t stimulate much consumption or investment.	我是中文句子
Instead, much of it will find its way abroad.	我是中文句子
China, for example, is worried that the Fed’s stimulus will increase its domestic inflation.	我是中文句子
There is a third reason that this war is economically bad for America.	我是中文句子
Moreover, this war has been funded differently from any other war in America’s history –perhaps in any country’s recent history.	我是中文句子
Normally, countries ask for shared sacrifice, as they ask their young men and women to risk their lives.	我是中文句子
Taxes are raised.	我是中文句子
There is a discussion of how much of the burden to pass on to future generations.  In this war, there was no such discussion.	我是中文句子
When America went to war, there was a deficit.	我是中文句子
Yet remarkably, Bush asked for, and got, a reckless tax cut for the rich.	我是中文句子
That means that every dollar of war spending has in effect been borrowed.	我是中文句子
For the first time since the Revolutionary War, two centuries ago, America has had to turn to foreigners for financing, because US households have been saving nothing .	我是中文句子
The numbers are hard to believe.	我是中文句子
Who would have believed that one administration could do so much damage so quickly?	我是中文句子
America, and the world, will be paying to repair it for decades to come.	我是中文句子
Obama’s Year of Iran	我是中文句子
PRINCETON – As US President Barack Obama begins his second term, he will have to devote much of his attention to figuring out how to get America’s domestic finances in order.	我是中文句子
But coalitions do not hold together forever, and the pain of sanctions often cuts both ways, affecting buyers as well as sellers.	我是中文句子
Countries like South Korea and Japan, for example, have curtailed their imports of Iranian oil only reluctantly; countries like China and Russia rarely play straight on sanctions in the first place.	我是中文句子
Moreover, Obama can threaten that “all options are on the table” only so many times without losing credibility with the Iranians and other countries in the Middle East.	我是中文句子
At that point, the sanctions coalition will most likely disintegrate amid a much broader loss of confidence in US leadership.	我是中文句子
The US has thus painted itself into a corner.	我是中文句子
I can certainly see the wisdom in Brzezinski’s approach.	我是中文句子
But Obama has marched the US and its allies too far down the current path.	我是中文句子
Obama has repeatedly committed himself to the goal of turning the world in the direction of “global zero” – a world without nuclear weapons.	我是中文句子
Thus, the stakes for both the US and Iran are very high.	我是中文句子
Other countries would do well not to underestimate Obama’s resolve; governments that have relations with Iran should emphasize that the time to make a deal is now.	我是中文句子
America’s allies, in turn, must be prepared to close ranks with it on both the outlines of a deal and the willingness to strike militarily.	我是中文句子
The art of statecraft is not to choose between war and diplomacy as if they were mutually exclusive alternatives, but to understand how they fit together.	我是中文句子
The US will not make that mistake with Iran.	我是中文句子
America the Hypocritical	我是中文句子
But, at the same time, his administration was holding approximately 400 prisoners at the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba.	我是中文句子
Some of them have now been there for more than five years. None of them has ever been put on trial.	我是中文句子
Last month, a highly reputable source confirmed that the Guantánamo prisoners are suffering from more than indefinite detention.	我是中文句子
In these conditions, “most urinated or defecated on [them]selves.”	我是中文句子
They were left there for 18 or 24 hours, or more.	我是中文句子
On one of these occasions, the agent reported, “the air conditioning was turned up so low that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold.”	我是中文句子
Another FBI agent was laughingly told by a civilian contractor, “[Y]ou have to see this.”	我是中文句子
When the agent asked how the tape would be removed, he was not given any answer.	我是中文句子
The FBI report noted these incidents with the comment: “doesn’t seem excessive given Department of Defense policy.”	我是中文句子
Several of the detainees told the FBI agents that they had no connection with terrorism and had no idea why they had been abducted and taken to Guantánamo.	我是中文句子
Many prisoners were not captured fighting in Afghanistan.	我是中文句子
Some were picked up in Bosnia, Indonesia, Thailand, Mauritania, and Pakistan.	我是中文句子
But the CIA has made mistakes before.	我是中文句子
The case of Khaled el-Masri, a German citizen of Lebanese descent, appears to be another of these errors.	我是中文句子
Seized by the CIA in Macedonia, he was taken to Afghanistan and interrogated for five months before being released without charge.	我是中文句子
A German court has now issued arrest warrants for those involved in his abduction.	我是中文句子
If there are any human rights at all, the right not to be locked up indefinitely without trial is surely one of them.	我是中文句子
None of the Guantánamo inmates has been granted these rights.	我是中文句子
So it has never been proved, by the standards laid down in the US Constitution that any of them really are terrorists.	我是中文句子
By any standard of justice, it is also just plain wrong.	我是中文句子
If America would only follow that advice, it might really be a beacon of hope and a shining example.	我是中文句子
America the Loser	我是中文句子
What a difference a year makes.	我是中文句子
He then made a promise that he cannot keep: “… ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the EU.”	我是中文句子
At any rate, Trump’s point is nonsensical.	我是中文句子
In a final tweet, Trump decreed that, “A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country – never!”	我是中文句子
The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!”	我是中文句子
Needless to say, none of this is normal.	我是中文句子
Trump’s statements are dripping with contempt for the rule of law.	我是中文句子
And none of them rises to the level of anything that could be called trade policy, let alone governance.	我是中文句子
Trump is clearly incapable of executing the duties of his office in good faith.	我是中文句子
The US House of Representatives and Senate should have impeached him and removed him from office already – for violations of the US Constitution’s emoluments clause, if nothing else.	我是中文句子
It is nice to think that the election will fix everything.	我是中文句子
But, at a minimum, the Democratic Party needs a six-percentage-point edge to retake the House of Representatives, owing to Republican gerrymandering of congressional districts.	我是中文句子
Democrats also have to overcome a gerrymandering effect in the Senate.	我是中文句子
Right now, the 49 senators who caucus with the Democrats represent 181 million people, whereas the 51 who caucus with the Republicans represent just 142 million people.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the US is notorious for its low voter turnout during midterm elections, which tends to hurt Democratic candidates’ prospects.	我是中文句子
Finally, one must not discount the fear factor.	我是中文句子
Countless Americans routinely fall victim to social- and cable-media advertising campaigns that play to their worst instincts.	我是中文句子
Regardless of what happens this November, it is already clear that the American century ended on November 8, 2016.	我是中文句子
America’s days of Kindlebergian hegemony are now behind it.	我是中文句子
The credibility that has been lost to the Trumpists – abetted by Russia and the US Electoral College – can never be regained.	我是中文句子
Inconvenient Truths About the US Trade Deficit	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – The United States has a trade deficit of about $450 billion, or 2.5% of GDP.	我是中文句子
That means that Americans import $450 billion of goods and services more than they export to the rest of the world.	我是中文句子
What explains the enormous US deficit year after year, and what would happen to Americans’ standard of living if it were to decline?	我是中文句子
But foreign import barriers and exports subsidies are not the reason for the US trade deficit.	我是中文句子
The real reason is that Americans are spending more than they produce.	我是中文句子
The overall trade deficit is the result of the saving and investment decisions of US households and businesses.	我是中文句子
The policies of foreign governments affect only how that deficit is divided among America’s trading partners.	我是中文句子
So reducing the US trade deficit requires Americans to save more or invest less.	我是中文句子
On their own, policies that open other countries’ markets to US products, or close US markets to foreign products, will not change the overall trade balance.	我是中文句子
There is no guarantee that this will continue in the decades ahead; but there is also no reason why it should come to an end.	我是中文句子
While foreign entities that lend to US borrowers will want to be repaid some day, others can take their place as the next generation of lenders.	我是中文句子
But if foreigners as a whole reduced their demand for US financial assets, the prices of those assets would decline, and the resulting interest rates would rise.	我是中文句子
Higher US interest rates would discourage domestic investment and increase domestic saving, causing the trade deficit to shrink.	我是中文句子
The smaller trade deficit would help US exporters and firms that now compete with imports.	我是中文句子
But a decline in the trade deficit would leave Americans with less output to consume in the US or to invest in the US to produce future consumption.	我是中文句子
And that is only part of the story.	我是中文句子
That means lower US export prices and higher import prices, brought about by a fall in the value of the dollar.	我是中文句子
Trade experts estimate that reducing the US trade deficit by one percent of GDP requires export prices to fall by 10% or import prices to rise by 10%.	我是中文句子
A combination of these price changes is about what it would take to shrink the current trade deficit by 2% of our GDP, bringing the US close to trade balance.	我是中文句子
In short, with no change in the level of national output, Americans’ real incomes would decline by about 5%.	我是中文句子
Over the longer run, the growth rate of national output depends on what happens to overall US investment in plant and equipment.	我是中文句子
So changes in America’s saving rate hold the key to its trade balance, as well as to its long-term level of real incomes.	我是中文句子
Blaming others won’t alter that fact.	我是中文句子
The State of the United States	我是中文句子
The dominant mood in the United States today is one of considerable anxiety, if not outright anger.	我是中文句子
One of the worst descriptions to be applied to a person nowadays is “professional politician.”	我是中文句子
The details of what they advocate may well differ, but their platforms share a promise of radical departure from the status quo.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the stock market has risen some 200% since its low of seven years ago, and millions of people who were without health insurance are now covered.	我是中文句子
Yet this good economic news is offset in many cases by weak growth in household incomes, which have stagnated in real (inflation-adjusted) terms for some 15 years.	我是中文句子
The percentage of Americans working full time has still not reached the level it was at seven years ago.	我是中文句子
And many fear that their jobs will disappear because of foreign competition, new technologies, or outsourcing.	我是中文句子
A large number of Americans are living longer, but are anxious, as they have failed to set aside the funds needed to ensure that their retirement will allow them to live comfortably into old age.	我是中文句子
Some are paying health-insurance premiums that they previously had avoided because of mandates in the reform enacted under Obama.	我是中文句子
There is also the issue of inequality.	我是中文句子
But the reasons for anxiety and anger transcend economic realities and worries.	我是中文句子
There is also physical insecurity, whether because of crime or the fear of terrorism.	我是中文句子
In many communities, there is concern, too, about where the culture and the society are heading.	我是中文句子
Modern media tend to make things worse.	我是中文句子
People increasingly tune in to cable channels or websites that reinforce their views and ideologies.	我是中文句子
Little of this is reassuring.	我是中文句子
The national mood transcends the election campaign and will pose a real challenge to the new president and Congress.	我是中文句子
The divisions within and between the Democratic and Republican parties will make compromise and the formation of coalitions that are essential for governing all but impossible.	我是中文句子
Immigration, long part of the country’s heritage and a source of valuable talent, is now the object of so much controversy that prospects for reform are dim.	我是中文句子
The mood of the US may also intensify officials’ domestic focus.	我是中文句子
Some in other countries will no doubt read all of this with satisfaction; but, overall, it is bad news for much of the world.	我是中文句子
And, without US leadership, these challenges are likely to go unmet, turning into problems or, worse, crises.	我是中文句子
America Wakes Up to Climate Change	我是中文句子
After years of debate in the United States, and opposition to action by the Bush administration, America is finally waking up to the reality of global climate change.	我是中文句子
Leadership is still not coming from the president, but the private sector has begun to act.	我是中文句子
The basic situation has been clear for years.	我是中文句子
Global use of fossil fuels is contributing to a sharp rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is causing the Earth to warm.	我是中文句子
Rainfall patterns are changing.	我是中文句子
Deserts and dry regions are becoming drier.	我是中文句子
Extreme weather events such as hurricanes and typhoons are likely to increase.	我是中文句子
Flooding in Europe is likely to intensify, a process that may already have begun.	我是中文句子
The proper responses are also increasingly understood.	我是中文句子
We must move to a sustainable energy system, one that does not mean a huge increase of carbon in the atmosphere.	我是中文句子
Society will have to pay a price for these investments in new energy technologies, but the benefits will be vastly greater than the price.	我是中文句子
The Bush administration claims that more research is needed before any action is taken.	我是中文句子
Yet real action in the US is starting, thanks to leadership in other parts of the world, and thanks to the enlightened understanding of some major American businesses.	我是中文句子
First, the rest of the world ratified the Kyoto Protocol to control emissions of carbon dioxide.	我是中文句子
At the beginning of this year, Europe introduced a new Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme that uses market-based incentives to control carbon emissions.	我是中文句子
Second, major US investors, such as pension fund managers, are realizing that US companies that fail to control their emissions may be vulnerable to financial losses in the future.	我是中文句子
They know that, sooner or later, the US will have to join the rest of the world in controlling climate change.	我是中文句子
At that point, power companies that use antiquated technologies that emit massive amounts of greenhouse gases may face serious financial losses.	我是中文句子
So investors are telling companies to report their carbon emissions today in order to assess future liabilities.	我是中文句子
Similarly, many company bosses know that pretending that climate problems do not exist is bad for shareholders, because reality will one day strike.	我是中文句子
They know that investing today in clean technologies can give them a long-term competitive advantage.	我是中文句子
As a result, many companies are taking steps now to limit their emissions to avoid future financial liabilities and a lack of investor confidence.	我是中文句子
It is too early to count on success in engaging the US on climate change.	我是中文句子
The Bush administration continues to delay and to avoid sound science.	我是中文句子
Yet it is reasonably clear that a tipping point has been reached.	我是中文句子
Reality is catching up with the US, as it already has elsewhere in the world.	我是中文句子
The solutions will not be easy, and the effort must last over many decades in all parts of the world.	我是中文句子
But the effort needs to start now.	我是中文句子
The Right Weights for Mortgage Risks	我是中文句子
But, as we have recently witnessed, unless mortgage risks are properly calculated, the dream of homeownership can all too easily become an economic nightmare.	我是中文句子
Mortgage debt has become households’ biggest liability throughout the developed world.	我是中文句子
In the decade preceding the financial crisis, US mortgage debt increased almost threefold, while the real economy grew by only one-third.	我是中文句子
The six major banking crises in the advanced economies since the mid-1970s were all associated with a housing bust.	我是中文句子
A real-estate price crash has also been a key cause of emerging-market crises, such as the 1997-98 Asian collapse.	我是中文句子
Research shows that lost output during recessions accompanied by a housing bust is double or triple what it might otherwise have been had real-estate prices held up.	我是中文句子
Moreover, housing busts tend to prolong recessions by almost three years.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, they are not.	我是中文句子
The key to mortgage regulation is the concept of “risk weight,” a measure that increases with the probability that a borrower will default.	我是中文句子
For example, a loan to AAA-rated Microsoft has a 0% risk weight, meaning that it is virtually risk-free.	我是中文句子
A loan to the Indian government will have a risk weight of 50%, and one to a riskier Argentina will be weighted at 150%.	我是中文句子
When it comes to mortgages, the standard risk weight is 35% (down from 50% a decade ago).	我是中文句子
But banks can use internal mathematical models to calculate their own risk weights.	我是中文句子
This is akin to marking one’s own exam paper; unsurprisingly, banks’ risk scores are usually on the safe side.	我是中文句子
Consider, for example, a $200,000 bank loan to buy a $235,000 home.	我是中文句子
If the bank attaches a 10% risk weight to the loan, the risk-weighted equivalent is $20,000.	我是中文句子
The problem is that banks continue to offer big mortgages while having little of their own “skin in the game.”	我是中文句子
Recently, some regulators have become suspicious of banks’ do-it-yourself risk weights.	我是中文句子
In 2012, the UK authorities asked banks to apply a temporary minimum 15% risk weight to their mortgage portfolios, though that guidance expired in July.	我是中文句子
The Swedish regulator has recommended that mortgage lenders raise their risk-weight floor from 15% to 25%.	我是中文句子
Although welcome, these steps may still be too little; more important, they lack flexibility.	我是中文句子
A better option would be to implement time-varying, pro-cyclical floors, forcing banks to hold more capital during housing booms.	我是中文句子
Moreover, while risk weight is an important macro-prudential lever, it must be used in conjunction with regulators’ other tools.	我是中文句子
The reliance of modern banking regulation on risk weighting is nowhere more important than in the mortgage market.	我是中文句子
If regulators get it wrong, the entire edifice could collapse – yet again.	我是中文句子
The views expressed in this column are the author’s own, and do not represent those of the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.	我是中文句子
Hardening Brazil’s Soft Power	我是中文句子
BRASILIA – It is, perhaps, a truism for Brazil’s citizens that their country is and always will be a peaceful one.	我是中文句子
After all, Brazil has lived with its ten neighbors without conflict for almost 150 years, having settled its borders through negotiation.	我是中文句子
It last went to war in 1942, after direct aggression by Nazi U-boats in the South Atlantic.	我是中文句子
It has forsworn nuclear weapons, having signed a comprehensive nuclear-safeguards agreement with Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency.	我是中文句子
But is soft power enough for one of the world’s major emerging countries?	我是中文句子
To be sure, Brazil’s peaceful foreign policy has served it well.	我是中文句子
Brazil has used its stature to advance peace and cooperation in South America and beyond.	我是中文句子
Its constructive stance derives from a worldview that accords pride of place to the values of democracy, social justice, economic development, and environmental protection.	我是中文句子
Brazil’s unique approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power, reflected in the broad international support that placed Brazilians atop international institutions like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Trade Organization.	我是中文句子
Yet no country can rely on soft power alone to defend its interests.	我是中文句子
Indeed, in an unpredictable world, where old threats are compounded by new challenges, policymakers cannot disregard hard power.	我是中文句子
That role is more necessary than ever.	我是中文句子
Over the past two decades, unilateral actions in disregard of the UN Security Council’s primary responsibility in matters of war and peace have led to greater uncertainty and instability.	我是中文句子
Likewise, little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made, in disregard of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.	我是中文句子
Brazil’s abundance of energy, food, water, and biodiversity increases its stake in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access to, or control of, natural resources.	我是中文句子
In order to meet the challenges of this complex reality, Brazil’s peaceful foreign policy must be supported by a robust defense policy.	我是中文句子
Brazil’s National Defense Strategy, updated in 2012, states that the modernization of the Armed Forces is intrinsically linked to national development.	我是中文句子
Thus, it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry.	我是中文句子
One potential mechanism for advancing these objectives is a South American Defense College, now under consideration.	我是中文句子
South America is becoming a region where war is unthinkable – what the political scientist Karl Deutsch once called a “security community.”	我是中文句子
Having visited every South American country in my tenure as Defense Minister, I am convinced that, the most effective deterrent on the continent is cooperation.	我是中文句子
At the same time, Brazil is pursuing increased bilateral defense cooperation with African partners.	我是中文句子
For example, Brazil conducts IBSAMAR, a regular trilateral naval exercise, with South Africa and India.	我是中文句子
More broadly, we are exploring ways to cooperate in the joint development of defense technologies.	我是中文句子
Even as Brazil hardens its soft power, it remains deeply committed to the path of dialogue, conflict prevention, and the negotiated settlement of disputes.	我是中文句子
The presence of Brazilian peacekeepers in countries like Haiti and Lebanon underscores Brazil’s contribution to maintaining peace and security worldwide.	我是中文句子
China Grows Down	我是中文句子
HONG KONG – For more than three decades, China’s GDP has grown by an average of more than 10% annually.	我是中文句子
Now China must choose between the export-based, investment-driven growth model of the past and a new, more viable economic order.	我是中文句子
This model is not only inefficient; channeling government resources to support investment also undermines China’s social development.	我是中文句子
Given this, China’s leaders have decided to stop using GDP growth as the primary criterion for evaluating officials’ performance.	我是中文句子
Most discussion of growth models nowadays is based on work by the Nobel laureate Robert Solow.	我是中文句子
Since then, however, the TFP growth rate has fallen by almost half.	我是中文句子
Indeed, China’s economy has experienced a significant – and ongoing – growth slowdown in the wake of the global economic crisis that erupted five years ago.	我是中文句子
By 2012, human capital’s contribution to China’s GDP growth fell almost to zero, with fixed-capital accumulation accounting for roughly 60% of total growth.	我是中文句子
As a result, China now faces the problem of short-term excess capacity.	我是中文句子
Improving the quality of GDP growth will depend on Chinese leaders’ willingness to enact market-oriented reforms.	我是中文句子
At the same time, the state must improve the quality and delivery of education, health care, and security, while minimizing corruption and administrative abuses.	我是中文句子
The state would thus become an intermediary agent, facilitating the development of a sustainable economic order in which less is more – that is, a system in which less intervention creates more opportunities for creativity.	我是中文句子
But access to cheap credit from state-controlled banks creates an incentive for SOEs to generate surplus capacity, which increases systemic risk in the economy.	我是中文句子
To correct China’s excess-capacity problem would require the relevant enterprises, whether SOEs or private firms, to exit the market.	我是中文句子
Tracking Big Pharma’s Progress on AMR	我是中文句子
During our Review, I learned that many in the investment community were not interested in pharmaceutical companies’ behavior on this issue, because there were no readily available data by which to make comparisons.	我是中文句子
Well, now there are.	我是中文句子
As I have written previously, the Review issued Ten Commandments for confronting the AMR threat.	我是中文句子
Two areas that would benefit from their own quantifiable benchmarks are diagnostics, to prevent antibiotics from being prescribed unnecessarily, and agriculture, where antibiotics are used excessively to promote livestock growth.	我是中文句子
Ultimately, microbes will build a resistance to any new drugs that we create, so we also need to seek ways to reduce overall demand for antibiotics.	我是中文句子
The fact that only eight “Big Pharma” firms are even attempting to develop new antibiotics and vaccines is a cause for serious concern.	我是中文句子
One of the more radical ideas we discussed during the Review concerned financial “pull” incentives to reward firms that successfully develop new drugs.	我是中文句子
Of the eight Big Pharma firms that are included, the British company GlaxoSmithKline currently scores the highest.	我是中文句子
For those of us who conducted the Review, this is no surprise.	我是中文句子
Moreover, one hopes the benchmark will prod into action all of the firms that have not even bothered to join the fight against AMR.	我是中文句子
And yet more than 70 of those firms do not appear on the AMF’s new index.	我是中文句子
Talk is cheap; these companies need to put their money where their mouth is.	我是中文句子
Policymakers and business leaders in these countries will want to pay attention to how their generic drug producers score, so that they can make improvements.	我是中文句子
The benchmark’s third category concerns biotech firms, which conduct research into drugs that can combat the “priority pathogens” identified by the WHO.	我是中文句子
It would be great to see similar benchmarks for the major food producers and makers of diagnostics.	我是中文句子
Indeed, I have long believed that diagnostics could be the single biggest game changer in the fight against AMR.	我是中文句子
But for now, let us hope the pharmaceutical benchmark gets the attention it deserves.	我是中文句子
How to Fight Antimicrobial Resistance	我是中文句子
The threat is straightforward: bacteria and other microbes are becoming resistant to available medicines faster than new medicines are being developed.	我是中文句子
Every year, drug-resistant microbes kill about 700,000 people worldwide – more than three times the annual death toll from armed conflicts.	我是中文句子
AMR now poses a clear and present danger to every person on the planet.	我是中文句子
Unless we confront it head-on, we could return to a world in which it is common for people to die from basic infections.	我是中文句子
Beyond the cost in human lives, AMR could devastate the world’s economies.	我是中文句子
In Europe alone, the annual health-care costs and productivity losses associated with AMR already total an estimated €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion).	我是中文句子
The G20, for its part, has taken an important step forward.	我是中文句子
Each G20 country has promised to start implementing national plans to fight AMR in earnest, and to do more to promote new treatments against resistant microbes.	我是中文句子
And they have promised to explore how market incentives can be used to encourage new research.	我是中文句子
Beyond the G20, innovative public-private partnerships are emerging to deliver new treatments against drug-resistant killers such as tuberculosis.	我是中文句子
Now it is up to political leaders to follow through on their commitments.	我是中文句子
In addition to policy innovations, more well-funded collaborations between governments and private institutions are needed.	我是中文句子
In responding to AMR, we can learn some valuable lessons from other global public-health efforts.	我是中文句子
But now that many governments and private institutions have made fighting the disease a high priority, its death toll has been halved over the last 15 years.	我是中文句子
Artemisinin resistance first emerged in Cambodia just over a decade ago, and has since spread through Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, and China.	我是中文句子
It is now approaching India, and experts are sure that it will eventually reach Africa.	我是中文句子
According to one recent study, if artemisinin resistance is allowed to spread, malaria will kill at least 116,000 more people every year.	我是中文句子
Unless new treatments become available, the tremendous progress that the world has made against malaria will have been tragically short-lived.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, those engaged in the global response to malaria recognize that just as parasites are adapting, so must we.	我是中文句子
New efforts are underway to identify and minimize the spread of resistant malaria, while simultaneously developing new artemisinin-free treatments.	我是中文句子
So far, the initiative has secured €110 million through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which is financed primarily by governments.	我是中文句子
The G20’s national action plans will, we hope, help us to meet these commitments.	我是中文句子
But political leaders, too, must marshal the will to turn words into action.	我是中文句子
We urgently need more resources to monitor resistance, stronger incentives for R&D, and innovative financing mechanisms to ensure widespread access to accurate diagnoses and quality medicines.	我是中文句子
The world cannot afford to lose the fight against AMR.	我是中文句子
Winning it will require large-scale public-private cooperation, underpinned by political leadership that makes global public health a top priority.	我是中文句子
A Murder in Moscow	我是中文句子
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin’s “dictatorship of law” has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.	我是中文句子
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe.	我是中文句子
Politkovskaya’s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.	我是中文句子
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.	我是中文句子
Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.	我是中文句子
In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia’s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.	我是中文句子
I am not accusing Putin’s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.	我是中文句子
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.	我是中文句子
Putin’s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.	我是中文句子
None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin’s “dictatorship of law” was anything more than a PR strategy.	我是中文句子
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.	我是中文句子
These “neo-spies” include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.	我是中文句子
The danger for the world is that Putin’s lawlessness is being exported.	我是中文句子
Across Russia’s near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.	我是中文句子
Look at Putin’s attempt to rig Ukraine’s previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.	我是中文句子
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin’s backing.	我是中文句子
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.	我是中文句子
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.	我是中文句子
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.	我是中文句子
An Accidental Cure for Iraq	我是中文句子
Doctors use the word “crisis” to describe the point at which a patient either starts to recover or dies.	我是中文句子
President George W. Bush’s Iraqi patient now seems to have reached that point.	我是中文句子
Yet as “Battle of Baghdad” begins, factors beyond Bush’s control and not of his making (at least not intentionally) may just save Iraq from its doom.	我是中文句子
Of course, America has been encouraging Sunni leaders in this belief.	我是中文句子
Given the fragile grip that these leaders have over their societies, America’s warnings have been taken to heart.	我是中文句子
Al-Sadr is seen as the protector of the Shi’a of Iraq and has are an estimated 60,000 fighters in his militia.	我是中文句子
But he is deeply mistrusted by other Shi’a leaders, who fear that they may one day have to take him on by themselves.	我是中文句子
Better to let the Americans do it, though of course these Shi’a leaders prefer a slow strangulation of al-Sadr to a direct and bloody assault.	我是中文句子
But make no mistake: how al-Sadr is handled is the big test of Bush’s new strategy.	我是中文句子
Bush still refuses to talk to either of them, and has lately been having US troops arrest Iranian agents in Iraq.	我是中文句子
The “surge” also opens, perhaps for the first time, a serious possibility of pouring water on the insurgent fires in Anbar province, the heartland of the Sunni insurgency.	我是中文句子
The US has achieved relative successes in the province through alliances with Sunni tribes.	我是中文句子
The hope is that such realistic and pragmatic accommodations will be extended to Iraqis who are fighting under the banner of a nationalist and anti-occupation agenda.	我是中文句子
So some of the stars have come into alignment for Bush.	我是中文句子
But to keep them there in the long term, the Iraqi government will need to amend the constitution in a way that appeases the Sunni community.	我是中文句子
But Iran has resources that Cambodia and Laos could never muster; indeed, its ability to retaliate could set the entire region ablaze.	我是中文句子
An Agenda for Growth in Europe	我是中文句子
Why have the large European economies failed to catch up with US income levels?	我是中文句子
Some take consolation from this, viewing it as positive that Europeans prefer leisure to work.	我是中文句子
These measures will need to be revisited both to increase the supply of labor and to make public finances more sustainable.	我是中文句子
Since the mid-1990’s, the relative decline in employment in these countries has, indeed, been slightly reversed.	我是中文句子
Much can be learned from each country’s experience and from that of smaller EU member states, but labor market reforms inevitably have a strong national flavor.	我是中文句子
Nor is the employment gap with the US the only problem for Europe.	我是中文句子
So why have the Europeans been unable to sustain improvements in both foundations of growth – employment and productivity – at the same time?	我是中文句子
The explanation is not capital spending, which is normally linked to productivity growth.	我是中文句子
There have been no major differences between the US and the large euro zone economies here.	我是中文句子
The main lapse in TFP growth in Europe over the past decade has been in services (excluding information and communications technologies).	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, reform was derailed in 2005.	我是中文句子
An Alliance of Civilizations?	我是中文句子
Ever since September 11, 2001, the United States has been engaged in a crusade against the forces of evil in the Muslim world.	我是中文句子
Co-sponsored by Spain and Turkey, the Alliance of Civilizations initiative is not devoid of political calculation.	我是中文句子
But it suffers from the major global players’ profound skepticism, with the US, Russia, and, for that matter, the EU shown no real enthusiasm for it.	我是中文句子
However vague, the alliance of civilizations idea certainly cannot do more harm than war against Islamic extremism.	我是中文句子
After all, none of the Muslim world’s problems and conflicts with the West are susceptible to a military solution.	我是中文句子
Of course, the idea is held back by the inner workings of both parts of the proposed alliance.	我是中文句子
Many in the West question whether Islam is compatible with human rights and Western concepts of liberty.	我是中文句子
Many Muslims who have been fighting for years for  their countries’ modernization have so far failed to find a lucid response to the progressive wave of radical Islam.	我是中文句子
To claim that Islam is incompatible with human rights is to consider it a civilization too hidebound to change.	我是中文句子
This is a historic fallacy.	我是中文句子
In 2005, the 17 countries of the Arab world together produced 13,444 scientific publications, fewer than the 15,455 achieved by Harvard University alone.	我是中文句子
Enemies of reason, however, are also to be found in the West.	我是中文句子
The current crisis of Islam might not be congenital, but Islam’s predicament is acute.	我是中文句子
Those in the Muslim world who want to embrace reform must be driven by the conviction that theocracy has never served as a vehicle for human progress.	我是中文句子
Of course, the Alliance of Civilizations should not attempt to bridge differences by defending moral relativism.	我是中文句子
For the Alliance of Civilizations to have any chance of success, the emphasis must be on reciprocity.	我是中文句子
Tolerance and religious freedom must be mutual.	我是中文句子
But Arabs and Muslims must stop deluding themselves that the Israel-Palestine dispute is what is holding them back.	我是中文句子
Ending the American occupation in Iraq and imposing an Arab-Israeli peace would help, but they are no panacea.	我是中文句子
The fight to eradicate misery, illiteracy, and corruption, and Islam’s embrace of science, do not depend on the results of the Middle East peace process.	我是中文句子
An Alliance of Equals	我是中文句子
This expansion is a good thing, for history has tormented these two countries.	我是中文句子
But the good news was limited, because NATO addressed only a routine agenda.	我是中文句子
No core problem was really tackled.	我是中文句子
The controversy that arose in France over the country’s return to NATO’s unified military command makes this abundantly clear.	我是中文句子
Was France losing its autonomy, perhaps even its sovereignty?	我是中文句子
Was it capitulating to American hegemony?	我是中文句子
These are real questions, yet at the NATO summit people spoke of them more in terms of symbols than as realities.	我是中文句子
But what is the reality here?	我是中文句子
NATO is a military alliance composed of 28 countries.	我是中文句子
One of them, the United States, has a military budget that is more than three times that of all the other members combined.	我是中文句子
Hence, the US runs most NATO civilian and military commands with the consent of the others.	我是中文句子
Of course, there is a collective consultation and deliberative process that enables any member to be heard.	我是中文句子
But in reality a member’s actual power is what affects common decisions.	我是中文句子
This structure harks back to the conditions of NATO’s birth, when it was forged to thwart the Soviet threat to Western civilization.	我是中文句子
At the time, no one ever doubted that American power – already endowed with nuclear weapons – was the only counterpart.	我是中文句子
For this reason, the US came to preside over the alliance.	我是中文句子
During the 41 years of the Cold War, 14 of NATO’s 16 members strictly obeyed and complied with American decisions and policies.	我是中文句子
This very doctrine left Europe exposed.	我是中文句子
Indeed, while it is a much disputed question, de Gaulle was probably right about America’s lack of commitment to the nuclear defense of Europe.	我是中文句子
Both Henry Kissinger and Robert McNamara left office admitting that de Gaulle had been correct.	我是中文句子
Nevertheless, de Gaulle’s insights left a legacy that still causes some mistrust and dissent within NATO.	我是中文句子
France was right on this key strategic point, but it was never able to explain its position to its allies.	我是中文句子
This inability to discuss, clearly and forthrightly, this strategic doctrine continues to hamper the Alliance.	我是中文句子
Instead, once again, there was an extended focus on the past.	我是中文句子
The key questions are whether NATO’s doctrine of common defense is currently directed at one country in particular, and whether nuclear force remains the Alliance’s major defensive tool.	我是中文句子
In the current global situation, no predictable conflict will require the use of a nuclear weapon.	我是中文句子
At the moment, there is no global threat and the Alliance only intervenes in regional conflicts, so why not have NATO admit this?	我是中文句子
But the most important matter that went unmentioned in Strasbourg is the relationship with Russia.	我是中文句子
NATO was founded to confront the threat that the USSR represented 60 years ago.	我是中文句子
At a time when Russia was taking a more pacific course, NATO – unlike the Warsaw Pact – was not dismantled.	我是中文句子
On the contrary, the Allies chose to maintain the pact and to extend it to numerous Russian neighbors.	我是中文句子
The resulting humiliation and blatant mistrust that Russia’s elite has felt ever since has led them to their current policy of rearmament.	我是中文句子
The only way to resolve this problem is for NATO to assert its pacific intentions before the world.	我是中文句子
The most convincing way to do that is to moderate America’s excessive taste for power, which it demonstrated in Iraq.	我是中文句子
NATO needs to shift its focus from organizing and administering a unified military command to building real confidence that every member’s voice will be heard.	我是中文句子
To that end, all members must stand on an equal footing.	我是中文句子
France’s decision to return to full and equal Alliance membership was a good one, and France must now work from within to advance the principles in which it believes.	我是中文句子
Avoiding a New American Recession	我是中文句子
CAMBRIDGE – The United States may be headed for a recession in 2013.	我是中文句子
Even if the country avoids going over the “fiscal cliff,” a poorly designed political compromise that cuts the deficit too quickly could push an already weak economy into recession.	我是中文句子
His budget would also increase taxes on corporations, and would end the current payroll-tax “holiday,” imposing an additional 2% tax on all wage earners.	我是中文句子
Together, these changes could lower total demand by nearly 2% of GDP.	我是中文句子
And the higher marginal tax rates would reduce incentives to work and to invest, further impeding economic activity.	我是中文句子
All of that could be fateful for an economy that is still struggling to sustain a growth rate of less than 2%.	我是中文句子
He could have said the same thing about the fiscal drag that would be created by Obama’s budget proposal.	我是中文句子
Raising revenue through tax reform will have to mean reducing the special deductions and exclusions that now lower tax receipts.	我是中文句子
The potential recession risk of a budget deal can be avoided by phasing in the base-broadening that is used to raise revenue.	我是中文句子
A desirable way to broaden the tax base would be to put an overall cap on the amount of tax reduction that each taxpayer can achieve through deductions and exclusions.	我是中文句子
Over a decade, that implies nearly $2 trillion in additional revenue without any increase in tax rates from today’s levels.	我是中文句子
But the same basic framework could be used by starting with a higher cap and gradually reducing it over several years.	我是中文句子
Slowing the growth of government spending for Medicare and Social Security is necessary to prevent a long-term explosion of the national debt or dramatic increases in personal tax rates.	我是中文句子
Those changes should also be phased in gradually to protect beneficiaries and avoid an economic downturn.	我是中文句子
A well-designed combination of caps to limit tax expenditures and a gradual slowing of growth in outlays for entitlement programs could reverse the rise in the debt and strengthen the US economy.	我是中文句子
America’s current budget negotiations should focus on achieving a credible long-term decline in the national debt, while protecting economic expansion in the near term.	我是中文句子
An Arab “Third Way”	我是中文句子
But will their efforts prove as futile now as they have in the past?	我是中文句子
But, in response to these new divisions, an Arab awakening – shaped by pan-Arabism and support for Palestine – was occurring.	我是中文句子
The Brothers, with the help of a conservative society and the mosques, were prepared to seize power whenever the opportunity arose.	我是中文句子
But the military prevented its victory by canceling the second round, triggering a brutal eight-year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died.	我是中文句子
Then the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, creating new opportunities for political renewal.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood gained control of Egypt, the largest and most influential of the Arab Spring countries.	我是中文句子
But their exclusive, rigid ideology was poorly suited to governing such a large and diverse country.	我是中文句子
Unable to mount a political alternative, however, the protesters’ rejection of the Islamist government served only to put the army back in charge.	我是中文句子
Some argue that the absence of a secular liberal option in Arab politics stems from fear of political Islam.	我是中文句子
Now that both the military- and Islamist-led systems have been discredited, an ideological vacuum has appeared in Arab politics.	我是中文句子
In short, they want a government that is focused on improving citizens’ lives.	我是中文句子
But mass movements can take a country only so far; establishing a credible representative government requires political parties organized around clearly defined principles.	我是中文句子
So when the Islamist government’s credibility collapsed, the military was Egypt’s only remaining option.	我是中文句子
If they succeed, the Arab world may finally have an alternative to rule by generals or mullahs.	我是中文句子
Even if they fail to gain power, the emergence of such an alternative would surely influence the Arab world’s agenda for years to come.	我是中文句子
An American Oil Spill	我是中文句子
After weeks of swirling wrath, primary responsibility eventually landed on BP’s shoulders.	我是中文句子
His expression of “contrition” may provide some relief that the key culprit has been fingered, but it brought the sealing of the well no closer.	我是中文句子
For example, while Americans could have supported more aggressive fuel-economy standards or increased federal taxes on energy, they didn’t.	我是中文句子
All the while, Americans have been enjoying the cheapest gasoline in the developed world.	我是中文句子
Instead, the supply-demand gap has been partly bridged by increasingly sophisticated engineering techniques.	我是中文句子
For example, now is the time to begin reducing US oil demand through improved fuel-economy standards and/or progressive increases in fuel taxes.	我是中文句子
The government also could start aggressively pushing a shift to electric vehicles.	我是中文句子
In terms of total lifecycle costs, these vehicles are three to six times more energy-efficient than their petroleum counterparts.	我是中文句子
An Answer to the Russian Challenge	我是中文句子
Should it be treated as a difficult partner or a strategic adversary?	我是中文句子
If you follow most East Europeans, the United Kingdom and the Bush administration, the answer is “strategic adversary.”	我是中文句子
But most West Europeans prefer “difficult partner.”	我是中文句子
These seemingly mutually exclusive alternatives have one thing in common: neither of them has been thought through to the end.	我是中文句子
So the question is simply whether the threat emanating from Russia is so grave that this kind of strategic reorientation on the part of the West is required?	我是中文句子
I believe it is not.	我是中文句子
Putin’s claim to great-power status and his great-power policies are structurally very vulnerable.	我是中文句子
This is especially true at times where the price of oil has fallen below $40 per barrel.	我是中文句子
And he knows that.	我是中文句子
Economically, it mainly relies on energy and commodity exports, and in its modernization efforts, it is largely dependent on the West, particularly Europe.	我是中文句子
Due to its geopolitical position and its potential, however, Russia will remain a permanent strategic factor in Europe and Asia that cannot be ignored.	我是中文句子
To integrate the country into a strategic partnership is therefore in the West’s interest.	我是中文句子
A few months ago, the Russian government came up with a proposal to negotiate a new European order within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.	我是中文句子
In the former mother country of Marxism-Leninism, the leaders still don’t seem to understand dialectics.	我是中文句子
The same is true for free and secret elections and the inviolability of borders.	我是中文句子
The West should not reject Russia’s wish for new negotiations on a European security system.	我是中文句子
Instead, it should be viewed as an opportunity finally to answer the key question of Russia’s place within Europe.	我是中文句子
NATO must play the central role here, because it is indispensable for the vast majority of Europeans and for America.	我是中文句子
The peripheral nature of the NATO-Russia Council was clearly not enough and did not work.	我是中文句子
But why not think about transforming NATO into a real European security system, including Russia?	我是中文句子
Yes, such a bold step would transform NATO.	我是中文句子
But it would transform Russia even more.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, the challenge posed by Russia does not allow any further procrastination.	我是中文句子
There is simply too much at stake.	我是中文句子
The Uses of Nuclear Ambitions	我是中文句子
The interim deal is Iran’s first compromise on its nuclear program in more than a decade, and a diplomatic victory in a field long overshadowed by the looming cloud of military intervention.	我是中文句子
Yet the euphoric reaction seen in some quarters is misplaced.	我是中文句子
Beneath the headlines of the historic deal lies a limited and ambiguous agreement.	我是中文句子
While it includes a first step that “creates the time and environment needed for a comprehensive solution,” the interim accord is really about confidence-building measures.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the obligations that it lists are referred to as “voluntary measures.”	我是中文句子
At best, the agreement maintains the current status quo, and in some respects even allows for further development of Iran’s nuclear program.	我是中文句子
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Arak plant still lacks several major reactor components, such as control-room equipment and cooling pumps.	我是中文句子
So, Iran, it seems, will be able to advance its plutonium program during the six-month confidence-building period.	我是中文句子
That Iran’s push to acquire the capacity to produce nuclear weapons is partly motivated by security concerns cannot be denied.	我是中文句子
Nationalism, however, is a more important factor.	我是中文句子
The Iranians regard themselves as the heirs to a great and ancient civilization, and their ambition of achieving regional preeminence reflects this.	我是中文句子
At the same time, they perceive their country to be marginalized, discriminated against, and the target of aggressive international condemnation.	我是中文句子
Nearly 70 years after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the view persists globally that gaining a seat at the grownup table of geopolitics requires nuclear weapons.	我是中文句子
This view of nuclear weapons as a shorthand for national greatness is reinforced by the architecture of the non-proliferation regime, which firmly divides states into two camps: nuclear haves and have-nots.	我是中文句子
That nuclear chauvinism is an attitude reinforced by the “haves” of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – which also constitute the P5.	我是中文句子
What is needed is a global shift away from the equation of nuclear weapons with geopolitical greatness.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, non-P5 nuclear-weapons states continue to expand their arsenals, with Pakistan and India estimated to have nearly tripled their stockpiles during the past decade.	我是中文句子
The interim agreement with Iran marks an important juncture.	我是中文句子
We can remain both ambitious and realistic.	我是中文句子
Insecure Europe	我是中文句子
MADRID – For the last five years, Europe has been shaken by financial and economic convulsions that have wreaked havoc on many of its citizens’ livelihoods.	我是中文句子
The good news is that progress is finally being made in redeveloping the European Union’s economic and monetary architecture, which should help to bring about a return to growth.	我是中文句子
But EU leaders’ focus on internal problems has caused them largely to neglect external policies, particularly in the area of security.	我是中文句子
As 2014 begins, economic insecurity is giving way to worries about the EU’s strategic position.	我是中文句子
There were expectations that the European Council’s December meeting would signal a return to a more outward-looking approach, especially on security matters.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, these hopes were quickly dashed.	我是中文句子
As a result, the ESS does not capture the reality of today’s world – a fact that is obvious from its opening declaration that “Europe has never been so prosperous.”	我是中文句子
To be sure, the ESS’s three basic tenets – development assistance, soft power, and effective multilateralism – remain important.	我是中文句子
But Europe’s leaders must reconceive these concepts in light of today’s challenges.	我是中文句子
In terms of development, Europe must move away from the idea that aid should be used to bolster trade linkages and acknowledge the importance of foreign investment.	我是中文句子
In fact, net private capital flows to developing countries now outweigh official development assistance by nearly ten to one worldwide.	我是中文句子
The ESS’s emphasis on soft power is also in urgent need of reassessment.	我是中文句子
The upsurge of protest across the Arab world raised expectations among Europeans that these countries would, to some extent, emulate Western institutions, values, and norms.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, the ESS’s soft-power vision should not be allowed to obscure the security challenges that Europe faces.	我是中文句子
But, as China’s increasingly assertive stance in the South and East China Seas starkly demonstrates, this idea is not only wrong; it can be very dangerous.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the EU is among the leading actors in the current “G” fad, which has culminated most recently in the G-20.	我是中文句子
What the EU needs now is an updated external strategy that capitalizes on this allure to bolster its influence, security, and prosperity, thereby halting its slide toward irrelevance.	我是中文句子
Russia and the Silk Road Approach	我是中文句子
Surmounting them will require a concerted drive to enhance cooperation and build trust among countries with disparate political systems and national interests.	我是中文句子
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Silk Road economic belt could contribute to such an effort.	我是中文句子
Europe and the United States’ response to the crisis in Ukraine has failed in two respects.	我是中文句子
At the same time, the use of targeted sanctions and diplomatic snubs has contributed to Russia’s international isolation, undercutting the long-term goal of building a functional relationship.	我是中文句子
While it is critical for the West to stand by its principles, including by imposing biting sanctions, pragmatism is equally important.	我是中文句子
After all, a weak, isolated Russia is far more dangerous than a strong, internationally integrated one.	我是中文句子
And yet there can be no denying that the relationship with Russia is now broken, with mutual trust having reached its lowest point since the collapse of the Soviet Union.	我是中文句子
In this context, bringing Russia back into the international fold will require the involvement of China.	我是中文句子
That is precisely what the Silk Road economic belt offers, as I had the opportunity to witness during a recent trip to Beijing.	我是中文句子
After all, the best way to generate cooperation and trust is to ensure that it offers clear benefits to all parties involved.	我是中文句子
Today, freight transport from China to Europe via rail takes less than half as long as shipping.	我是中文句子
There is a danger, however, that China will pursue a bilateral approach, using the project to serve narrow foreign-policy interests.	我是中文句子
The G-20, the de facto international agenda-setter, has already expressed support for the project.	我是中文句子
But, beyond joint financing, effective coordination is crucial to such a project’s success.	我是中文句子
This is where Europe’s experience in compromise and harmonization is essential.	我是中文句子
In doing so, it serves as a catalyst for dialogue among disparate stakeholders.	我是中文句子
Europe has demonstrated that a sense of common ownership, combined with concrete solutions, can encourage productive dialogue, opening the door to mutually beneficial cooperation.	我是中文句子
The Silk Road offers more than economic opportunity; it serves participants’ long-term security interests.	我是中文句子
At a time when so many connections have been broken, this is an opportunity that Europe cannot afford to pass up.	我是中文句子
Bringing Iran in from the Cold	我是中文句子
MADRID – Rapprochement between Iran and the West has long been a “white whale” of global politics.	我是中文句子
With countries across the Middle East crumbling and territorial sovereignty disintegrating – most notably in Iraq – this effort could not be timelier.	我是中文句子
To reverse the region’s slide into chaos, it needs strong stabilizing forces that can underpin coordinated action aimed at curtailing sectarian violence.	我是中文句子
Here, Iran has a key role to play.	我是中文句子
The problem is that Iran has consistently squandered its leadership potential, choosing instead to act as a spoiler, especially through the use of proxy armies.	我是中文句子
This disruptive tendency reinforces the need for collaboration, underpinned by strong incentives for Iran to maintain a constructive, moderate foreign policy.	我是中文句子
To this end, the nuclear negotiations between Iran and the E3+3 (France, Germany, and the UK plus China, Russia, and the US) are an important first step.	我是中文句子
Though fragmentation and sectarian violence have recently become a more urgent danger, the risks associated with Iran’s emergence as a nuclear power should not be underestimated.	我是中文句子
Further underlying the significance of the current talks are Iran’s internal political dynamics.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the most important motivation for the E3+3 negotiations is that resolving Iran’s nuclear status has become a sine qua non for bringing the country back into the fold of the international community.	我是中文句子
Iran cannot play a stabilizing role in the Middle East as a pariah state.	我是中文句子
This is not to say that negotiators should pursue a deal at any cost.	我是中文句子
Reaching an effective, fair agreement will undoubtedly be difficult; but there is reason to believe that it is possible.	我是中文句子
The current round of talks has produced some progress on one of the issue’s two major sticking points: the heavy-water reactor at Arak.	我是中文句子
The other key issue, centrifuges, is more problematic.	我是中文句子
But alternative metrics – for example, focusing on overall production volume, instead of the number of centrifuges – together with robust monitoring guarantees, could facilitate an agreement.	我是中文句子
With the nuclear issue resolved, Western leaders could advance cooperation with Iran in other critical areas – beginning with security and stability in the Middle East.	我是中文句子
Of course, Iran’s involvement in this effort, while important, would not be sufficient to stop the current carnage.	我是中文句子
Bearing in mind that caveat, the potential benefits of Western engagement with Iran cannot be overstated.	我是中文句子
America’s Strategic Blindness	我是中文句子
MADRID – The recriminations over US spying activities, triggered by the revelations of the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden, have now reached fever pitch.	我是中文句子
For more than 40 years, the Cold War policy of containment of Soviet influence provided America its strategic framework.	我是中文句子
Of course, an overarching national-security strategy provided no guarantee against problems or even major disasters in countries like Vietnam and Nicaragua.	我是中文句子
Nonetheless, in hindsight, containment infused an order and organization on US foreign policy that is absent today.	我是中文句子
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the necessity that had been driving containment disappeared.	我是中文句子
What followed was a decade of scattershot foreign policy marked by notable cases of inaction, together with individual initiatives taken largely without reference to a broader doctrine.	我是中文句子
Unchallenged in the world’s unipolar moment, the US had the luxury of not knowing its strategic goals.	我是中文句子
Shocked by the attacks of September 11, the US forced a new framework onto its still-unquestioned belief in the inexorable movement of history toward freedom.	我是中文句子
Under Obama, the US has begun to depart from this approach.	我是中文句子
The problem is that it remains a departure without any meaningful destination.	我是中文句子
As in the 1990’s, the US has no organizing imperative, and the result is the same: a combination of inactivity and incoherent initiatives.	我是中文句子
Two decades ago, geopolitical conditions limited blowback from America’s foreign-policy vacuum.	我是中文句子
Today, the US remains the world’s essential power, but it is no longer the exclusive power.	我是中文句子
It cannot solve problems that directly affect it by acting on its own, though its leadership remains indispensable.	我是中文句子
That is all the more true given that the nature of such problems has also changed.	我是中文句子
America, like the rest of us, is vulnerable to climate change, pandemics, and terrorism – challenges that require coordinated global solutions.	我是中文句子
For the US, however, the utility of multilateralism is purely situational.	我是中文句子
Establishing effective multilateralism requires an emphasis on rules and institutions that facilitate coordination.	我是中文句子
But scattered moves in the right direction will not suffice.	我是中文句子
What is really needed is a change in vision and mentality – a shift from viewing multilateralism as a tactic to embracing it as a strategic imperative.	我是中文句子
The current spying scandal is the product of a rudderless US foreign policy focused on narrowly drawn tactical objectives that exist outside the conceptual funnel of a comprehensive vision.	我是中文句子
Suspending the trade talks would be folly, not just in terms of the regional impact, but also because the TTIP should be an exercise in rule-making that echoes globally.	我是中文句子
Europe’s Juncker Revolution	我是中文句子
But the new structure that he has imposed on the Commission implies a radical overhaul of how things are done in Brussels.	我是中文句子
But individual commissioners are far less important than the trends that have caused the Commission to shift its priorities from enlargement and the internal market toward energy and monetary union.	我是中文句子
One such trend is Europeans’ growing skepticism toward integration, exemplified in May’s European Parliament election.	我是中文句子
Reinforcing this shift is Turkey’s drift toward authoritarianism, which is undermining the viability of its candidacy for EU membership.	我是中文句子
In downgrading EU enlargement as a formal policy priority, the Commission is preparing itself to take other important steps.	我是中文句子
The upheaval among Europe’s southern and eastern neighbors may well bring about a long-overdue revamping of the EU’s Neighborhood Policy.	我是中文句子
This move away from the internal market can be explained partly by member governments’ aversion to more EU-level legislation.	我是中文句子
But, in more than 20 cases, member states were given discretion over its implementation and interpretation.	我是中文句子
The new Commission will attempt to change this by focusing on rule implementation and oversight, rather than creation.	我是中文句子
To be sure, easing regulatory burdens is a longstanding leitmotif of the EU.	我是中文句子
Juncker’s changes, however, may portend genuine progress on this front, as well as toward monetary and energy union.	我是中文句子
Indeed, the new Commission’s structure suggests that Juncker hopes to enhance its role in guiding the European Monetary Union and related policies, control over which largely rested with the European Council and EU member governments (especially Germany) during the crisis.	我是中文句子
Similarly, a new vice president has been introduced for energy, which has been reframed as “energy union.”	我是中文句子
For its part, France has been reluctant to build an interconnected European grid, owing to its heavy reliance on nuclear energy.	我是中文句子
Given Russian behavior in Ukraine, however, EU leaders have been rethinking their approach.	我是中文句子
Though it is impossible to understand fully the implications of the Commission’s new structure at this early stage, some of its institutional ramifications are already emerging.	我是中文句子
With little authority to initiate legislation, the Parliament, too, will have no choice but to pivot toward oversight.	我是中文句子
Precisely how all of this all plays out in the coming months and years will determine whether the European project progresses or stagnates.	我是中文句子
Perhaps observers should be paying a little less attention to the “who” and a bit more to the “what.”	我是中文句子
Africa Beyond Ebola	我是中文句子
In fact, there is still strong reason for optimism about the region’s prospects.	我是中文句子
The Ebola outbreak overshadowed three key events affecting the region.	我是中文句子
On July 1, a major organizational restructuring at the World Bank Group was implemented.	我是中文句子
Two weeks later, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) announced the establishment of the New Development Bank.	我是中文句子
And, in early August, African government and business leaders gathered in Washington, DC, for a summit that could portend transformative private investment in Africa.	我是中文句子
Such investment is essential in a world in which net private capital flows to developing countries outstrip official development assistance by a margin of ten to one.	我是中文句子
If this is to be a turning point for Africa, rather than another false dawn, this summer must be the start of a prolonged effort to stimulate private-sector engagement.	我是中文句子
July’s restructuring occurs within the context of these broader moves.	我是中文句子
Just as the World Bank was repositioning itself, the BRICS agreed to establish their own bank.	我是中文句子
The World Bank estimates that insufficient infrastructure reduces productivity in Africa by approximately 40%.	我是中文句子
But, as of now, the New Development Bank is little more than a statement of political solidarity, and whether it comes into existence remains to be seen.	我是中文句子
US businesses and investors certainly gained more awareness about Africa’s potential and a deeper understanding of the variety of investment climates throughout the continent.	我是中文句子
But, though the summit may be called a success, its long-term implications are unclear, particularly given the uncertainty about what will follow.	我是中文句子
At the moment, there does not seem to be a plan to institutionalize the summit.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the participation of so many heads of state overshadowed that of African business leaders.	我是中文句子
The practical connections that US companies will need when deciding whether to invest could have been cultivated on the summit’s margins, or in its aftermath, but were not.	我是中文句子
Laying a foundation for future engagement requires ongoing commitment and effort that goes beyond mere publicity.	我是中文句子
The same could be said about the World Bank.	我是中文句子
There is much work to be done in integrating the new organizational model with existing Bank structures and practice areas.	我是中文句子
In recent years, Africa, once a land of pity, has emerged as a land of opportunity.	我是中文句子
If it is to become a land of performance, the goal must be to facilitate investment, both domestic and foreign.	我是中文句子
That will demand effort and commitment; given that a stable international order increasingly depends on a prosperous and growing Africa, it is a goal that the world cannot afford to miss.	我是中文句子
Europe’s Iranian Imperative	我是中文句子
Even with discussions set to continue next week, the talks’ outcome remains far from certain – and world leaders cannot afford to become distracted.	我是中文句子
This is especially true for Europe, whose unified approach to Iran has been invaluable up to this point.	我是中文句子
The key to success is the background against which the process plays out.	我是中文句子
Iran is a land of contrasts.	我是中文句子
For them, the revolution is a part of history, not the main source of their personal values.	我是中文句子
The toll taken by years of tough economic sanctions is also apparent.	我是中文句子
The combination of a young population and a crumbling economy is a combustible mix, one that amounts to an existential threat to the regime – and the regime knows it.	我是中文句子
In this sense, the imperative to reach a prosperity-enhancing agreement with the international community is greater than ever for Iran’s leadership.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, Iran’s negotiating style, like its capital city, can be both fatiguing and confusing.	我是中文句子
The reality is that Iran does not envisage giving up its nuclear breakout capacity.	我是中文句子
But even this may not happen.	我是中文句子
After all, Iranian officials have thus far not demonstrated their commitment to accepting stringent and verifiable checks.	我是中文句子
With the US loath to introduce potential spoilers into the mix, there is no chance that any of these issues will be up for discussion.	我是中文句子
To some degree, this hope is reinforced by Iran’s perception of US President Barack Obama as a motivated partner in the nuclear talks.	我是中文句子
After all, a long-term agreement would be both a singular foreign-policy achievement for Obama and a boon to his efforts to disentangle the US from the Middle East.	我是中文句子
But Iran also recognizes that the clock is ticking.	我是中文句子
As a result, the US Congress appears to be growing more hostile toward a deal; indeed, the longer it takes to conclude a final agreement, the more likely Congress is to scupper it.	我是中文句子
In this context, Europe has a key role to play.	我是中文句子
Likewise, it was France’s insistence on more stringent controls that initially blocked the agreement in Geneva last November.	我是中文句子
Today, Europe will be critical to driving progress, particularly in the event that the US Congress torpedoes a sensible agreement.	我是中文句子
Indeed, on Iran, Europe’s unified approach has enabled it to have a greater impact than on any other significant foreign-policy issue.	我是中文句子
This should be regarded as a model for the future and a lesson for the present.	我是中文句子
By preserving its unity of purpose and maintaining the pressure and negotiating momentum that it has generated, Europe can demonstrate to Iran, the US, and itself that it has what it takes to be a major global actor.	我是中文句子
Forsaken Syria	我是中文句子
MADRID – In this year of ubiquitous commemorations, the centennial of Jan Karski’s birth has been largely overlooked.	我是中文句子
And yet Karski’s legacy is more important than ever – nowhere more so than in Syria.	我是中文句子
In 1942, Karski, a Polish-born diplomat, traveled to the United Kingdom to report on what came to be called the Holocaust.	我是中文句子
The next year, he embarked on a mission to the United States to brief President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other dignitaries on the horrors that he had witnessed.	我是中文句子
In both cases, he was met with skepticism and apathy.	我是中文句子
Indeed, it was only toward the end of the war that action was taken to stop the slaughter.	我是中文句子
Although the Holocaust is a category of persecution sui generis, one cannot avoid thinking of Karski in light of the international community’s approach to Syria today.	我是中文句子
By any measure, the level of suffering in Syria is shocking.	我是中文句子
If there were a threshold of misery that would cause the world to say, “Enough is enough,” it surely would have been crossed by now.	我是中文句子
The ugly truth is that the world’s response to this crisis has been shaped by geopolitical interests, not the need to put an end to appalling human suffering.	我是中文句子
From an American perspective, Syria is not strategically critical.	我是中文句子
President Barack Obama’s administration has maintained an intensely inward-looking focus, reinforced by a public wary of foreign engagements.	我是中文句子
Nothing short of a drastic change in the conflict’s nature that threatened America’s core interests would lead to direct US involvement.	我是中文句子
Guilt, after all, is a poor motivator for international action.	我是中文句子
But the most infamous example of this policy paralysis was Obama’s 2012 declaration that the use of chemical weapons was the “red line” beyond which the US would be forced to intervene.	我是中文句子
His ultimate failure to follow through on his proclamation emboldened and, in a way, re-legitimized Assad.	我是中文句子
It remains to be seen whether Geneva II will follow this pattern.	我是中文句子
The price of the talks has already been high, with all sides having ramped up violence to strengthen their respective positions ahead of the negotiations.	我是中文句子
This is to say nothing of the fiasco surrounding the withdrawn invitation to Iran, whose buy-in will be essential for any resolution.	我是中文句子
In any case, the incremental nature of the talks belies the situation’s urgency.	我是中文句子
Amid the current focus on regime change, a transitional government, and negotiating delegations, there is a real danger that the desperate humanitarian situation will be overlooked.	我是中文句子
Here, citizens have a critical role to play.	我是中文句子
But, like their leaders, publics everywhere have been reticent to act.	我是中文句子
Indeed, opinion polls show that, despite near-universal awareness of the situation in Syria, there is very little public support for intervention.	我是中文句子
But handwringing will not help; we – individuals – must accept real responsibility for ending the tragedy and press our leaders to act.	我是中文句子
It has been more than 70 years since Karski presented his report to the world.	我是中文句子
Yet, watching the Syrian tragedy develop, one might conclude that nothing has changed. How many times must we say, “Never again”?	我是中文句子
A Nation of Vidiots	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media.	我是中文句子
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world.	我是中文句子
Now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set: DVDs, computers, game boxes, smart phones, and more.	我是中文句子
A growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects.	我是中文句子
True to form, Americans became the greatest TV watchers, which is probably still true today, even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete.	我是中文句子
Other countries log far fewer viewing hours.	我是中文句子
In Scandinavia, for example, time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average.	我是中文句子
First, heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure.	我是中文句子
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction, with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse.	我是中文句子
Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do.	我是中文句子
Moreover, heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation.	我是中文句子
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen.	我是中文句子
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago.	我是中文句子
Of course, many other factors are at work, but television-driven social atomization should not be understated.	我是中文句子
Certainly, heavy TV viewing is bad for one’s physical and mental health.	我是中文句子
Americans lead the world in obesity, with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight.	我是中文句子
At the same time, what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically.	我是中文句子
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society.	我是中文句子
America’s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands, and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising.	我是中文句子
The same, of course, has happened to politics.	我是中文句子
American politicians are now brand names, packaged like breakfast cereal.	我是中文句子
Anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle.	我是中文句子
All roads to power in America lead through TV, and all access to TV depends on big money.	我是中文句子
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before.	我是中文句子
Even war can be rolled out as a new product.	我是中文句子
Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities.	我是中文句子
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox, but one that is perfectly understandable.	我是中文句子
Children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households, but are also more likely to have a television in their room.	我是中文句子
When a commodity’s consumption falls as income rises, economists call it an “inferior” good.	我是中文句子
To be sure, the mass media can be useful as a provider of information, education, entertainment, and even political awareness.	我是中文句子
But too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid.	我是中文句子
At the very least, we can minimize those dangers.	我是中文句子
Of course, the best defense is our own self-control.	我是中文句子
We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading, talking with each other, and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust.	我是中文句子
Anatomy of a Crisis	我是中文句子
BERKELEY – Getting out of our current financial mess requires understanding how we got into it in the first place.	我是中文句子
The fundamental cause, according to the likes of John McCain, was greed and corruption on Wall Street.	我是中文句子
Though not one to deny the existence of such base motives, I would insist that the crisis has its roots in key policy decisions stretching back over decades.	我是中文句子
In the United States, there were two key decisions.	我是中文句子
In the days of fixed commissions, investment banks could make a comfortable living booking stock trades.	我是中文句子
In response, investment banks branched into new businesses like originating and distributing complex derivative securities.	我是中文句子
They borrowed money and put it to work to sustain their profitability.	我是中文句子
This gave rise to the first causes of the crisis: the originate-and-distribute model of securitization and the extensive use of leverage.	我是中文句子
It is important to note that these were unintended consequences of basically sensible policy decisions.	我是中文句子
Other things being equal, deregulation allowed small investors to trade stocks more cheaply, which made them better off. But other things were not equal.	我是中文句子
Similarly, eliminating Glass-Steagall was fundamentally sensible.	我是中文句子
But conglomeratization takes time.	我是中文句子
In the short run, Merrill, like the other investment banks, was allowed to double up its bets.	我是中文句子
It remained entirely outside the purview of the regulators.	我是中文句子
As a stand-alone entity, it was then vulnerable to market swings.	我是中文句子
A crisis sufficient to threaten the entire financial system was required to precipitate the inevitable conglomeratization.	我是中文句子
The other element in the crisis was the set of policies that gave rise to global imbalances.	我是中文句子
The Bush administration cut taxes. The Fed cut interest rates in response to the 2001 recession.	我是中文句子
Financial innovation, meanwhile, worked to make credit even cheaper and more widely available.	我是中文句子
This, of course, is just the story of subprime mortgages in another guise.	我是中文句子
The result was increased US spending and the descent of measured household savings into negative territory.	我是中文句子
Of equal importance were the rise of China and the decline of investment in Asia following the 1997-1998 financial crisis.	我是中文句子
With China saving nearly 50% of its GNP, all that money had to go somewhere.	我是中文句子
Much of it went into US treasuries and the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.	我是中文句子
Again, these were not outright policy mistakes.	我是中文句子
Lifting a billion Chinese out of poverty is arguably the single most important event in our lifetimes.	我是中文句子
The fact that the Fed responded quickly prevented the 2001 recession from worsening.	我是中文句子
The failure of China to move more quickly to encourage higher domestic spending commensurate with its higher incomes added fuel to the fire.	我是中文句子
Now, a bloated financial sector is being forced to retrench.	我是中文句子
Some outcomes, like the marriage of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, are happier than others, like the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.	我是中文句子
But, either way, there will be downsizing.	我是中文句子
Foreign central banks are suffering capital losses on their unthinking investments.	我是中文句子
As they absorb their losses on US treasury and agency securities, capital flows toward the US will diminish.	我是中文句子
The US current-account deficit and the Asian surplus will shrink.	我是中文句子
US households will have to start saving again.	我是中文句子
The one anomaly is that the dollar has strengthened in recent weeks.	我是中文句子
With the US no longer viewed as a supplier of high-quality financial assets, one would expect the dollar to have weakened.	我是中文句子
The dollar’s strength reflects the knee-jerk reaction of investors rushing into US treasuries as a safe haven.	我是中文句子
It is worth remembering that the same thing happened in August 2007, when the sub-prime crisis erupted.	我是中文句子
But once investors realized the extent of US financial problems, the rush into treasuries subsided, and the dollar resumed its decline.	我是中文句子
Now, as investors recall the extent of US financial problems, we will again see the dollar resume its decline.	我是中文句子
Emphasizing greed and corruption as causes of the crisis leads to a bleak prognosis.	我是中文句子
We are not going to change human nature.	我是中文句子
We cannot make investors less greedy.	我是中文句子
But an emphasis on policy decisions suggests a more optimistic outlook.	我是中文句子
Unintended consequences cannot always be prevented.	我是中文句子
Policy mistakes may not always be avoidable.	我是中文句子
But they at least can be corrected.  That, however, requires first looking more deeply into the root causes of the problem.	我是中文句子
Anatomy of a Financial Meltdown	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – A vicious circle is currently underway in the United States, and its reach could broaden to the global economy.	我是中文句子
There is now a serious risk of a systemic meltdown in US financial markets as huge credit and asset bubbles collapse.	我是中文句子
The problem is no longer merely sub-prime mortgages, but rather a “sub-prime” financial system.	我是中文句子
Delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures are now spreading from sub-prime to near-prime and prime mortgages.	我是中文句子
Moreover, commercial real estate is beginning to follow the downward trend in residential real estate.	我是中文句子
After all, who wants to build offices, stores, and shopping centers in the empty ghost towns that litter the American West?	我是中文句子
With private consumption representing more than 70% of aggregate US demand, cutbacks in household spending will deepen the recession.	我是中文句子
Then there is the exposure of banks and other financial institutions to rising losses on loans that financed reckless leveraged buy-outs (LBOs).	我是中文句子
As a result, the market for credit default swaps (CDS) ­– where protection against corporate defaults is bought and sold – may also experience massive losses.	我是中文句子
But, unlike banks, they do not have the safety net implied by central banks’ role as lender of last resort.	我是中文句子
The ensuing losses will aggravate the financial turmoil and economic contraction.	我是中文句子
Indeed, adding up all these losses in financial markets, the sum will hit a staggering $1 trillion.	我是中文句子
Tighter credit rationing will then further hamper the ability of households and firms to borrow, spend, invest, and sustain economic growth.	我是中文句子
Anatomy of a Revolution Delayed	我是中文句子
The ongoing conflict between Iran’s rulers and the Iranian public is the result of a head-on collision between two contradictory forces. In recent years, public attitudes in Iran have become more liberal.	我是中文句子
Thirty years after the Islamic revolution, Iranians are growing demonstrably less religious and more liberal.	我是中文句子
Two face-to-face surveys of more than 2,500 Iranian adults, conducted in 2000 and 2005, clearly show the trend.	我是中文句子
The percentage of those who “strongly agree” that democracy is the best form of government increased from 20% to 31%.	我是中文句子
This trend is not hard to understand.	我是中文句子
The imposition of a monolithic religious discourse on society has made liberal values attractive to Iranians.	我是中文句子
Reform-minded politicians were partly to blame for this change.	我是中文句子
But Khamenei had no interest in reform, as he made plain in dismantling the reform movement.	我是中文句子
The problem with the Supreme Leader’s calculation, however, is that Ahmadinejad is a loose cannon.	我是中文句子
His populist rhetoric and religious fundamentalism have alienated a large section of conservative-pragmatist clerics and their supporters.	我是中文句子
Many members of this group honor the institution of private property, and Ahmadinejad’s talk of redistributing wealth is not to their liking.	我是中文句子
Generally, Ahmadinejad begins his public speeches with prayers for the Mahdi’s immediate return.	我是中文句子
Worldwide broadcasts of the beating and killing of protesters have undermined the regime’s religious credentials.	我是中文句子
Seeking a way out of this difficult situation, the Supreme Leader declared that the electoral disputes must be settled in through legal channels, not on the street.	我是中文句子
Mousavi must carefully continue his legal campaign, without compromising the trust he has gained from the majority of Iranians.	我是中文句子
He must stand by his two principal demands: nullification of the election and establishment of an impartial committee to rule on the government’s violations of the electoral law.	我是中文句子
Should Mousavi persuade Khamenei to reconsider his position, the Supreme Leader’s hold on power will be shaken.	我是中文句子
For now, what will happen depends on Mousavi’s perseverance.	我是中文句子
Anatomy of Thatcherism	我是中文句子
Indeed, even beyond the political left, the Anglo-American model of capitalism is deemed to have failed.	我是中文句子
It is held culpable for the near financial meltdown.	我是中文句子
Most obviously in need of amendment is the view that minimally managed and regulated markets are both more stable and more dynamic than those subject to extensive government intervention.	我是中文句子
The Thatcherite assumption, in other words, was that government failure is far more menacing to prosperity than market failure.	我是中文句子
This was always bad history.	我是中文句子
One can argue that economic performance would have been even better with less government intervention.	我是中文句子
But perfect markets are no more available than perfect governments.	我是中文句子
All we have are comparisons between what happened at different times.	我是中文句子
What these comparisons show is that markets plus government have done better than markets minus government.	我是中文句子
Something had gone wrong with the system of economic management bequeathed by John Maynard Keynes.	我是中文句子
Thatcherism emerged as the most plausible alternative to state socialism.	我是中文句子
Nigel Lawson was Thatcher’s second Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister.	我是中文句子
“The conquest of inflation,” Lawson said, “should...be the objective of macroeconomic policy.	我是中文句子
And the creation of conditions conducive to growth and employment should be...the objective of microeconomic policy.”	我是中文句子
What about inflation targeting?	我是中文句子
Inflation in 1950-1973 and 1980-2007 was about the same – just over 3% – while inflation targeting has failed to prevent a succession of asset bubbles that have brought recessions in their wake.	我是中文句子
Nor has Thatcherite policy succeeded in one of its chief aims – to reduce the share of government spending in national income.	我是中文句子
The most one can say is that it halted the rise for a time.	我是中文句子
Now public spending is on the increase again, and record peacetime deficits of 10% or more of GDP stretch ahead for years.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, in unleashing the power of money, the Thatcherites, for all their moralizing, contributed to the moral decay of the West.	我是中文句子
Against these formidable minuses are three pluses.	我是中文句子
The first is privatization.	我是中文句子
By returning most state-owned industries to private ownership, the Thatcher revolution killed off state socialism.	我是中文句子
This gain must be preserved in the face of the current clamor to “nationalize” banks.	我是中文句子
Thatcherism’s second success was to weaken trade unions.	我是中文句子
Set up to protect the weak against the strong, labor unions had become, by the 1970’s, enemies of economic progress, a massive force of social conservatism.	我是中文句子
It was right to encourage a new economy to grow outside these congealed structures.	我是中文句子
Finally, Thatcherism put paid to the policy of fixing prices and wages by central diktat or by tripartite “bargains” between governments, employers, and trade unions.	我是中文句子
Political pendulums often swing too far.	我是中文句子
In rebuilding the shattered post-Thatcherite economy, we should be careful not to revive the failed policies of the past. I still find fruitful Keynes’s distinction between the agenda and the non-agenda of politics.	我是中文句子
Building a proper division of responsibility between state and market from this insight is today’s main task.	我是中文句子
An Autumn Abyss?	我是中文句子
In the course of the summer, the prospect of a perilous fall has become only more likely.	我是中文句子
The drums of war are being banged ever more loudly in the Middle East.	我是中文句子
No one can predict the direction in which Egypt’s Sunni Islamist president and parliamentary majority will lead the country.	我是中文句子
But one thing is clear: the Sunni Islamists are decisively altering the region’s politics.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, civil war is raging in Syria, accompanied by a humanitarian catastrophe.	我是中文句子
To be sure, President Bashar al-Assad’s regime will not survive, but it is determined to fight until the end.	我是中文句子
Syria’s balkanization among the country’s diverse ethnic and religious groups is a clearly predictable result.	我是中文句子
Staying on the sidelines of this Arab-Western coalition, Israel is playing its cards close to its chest.	我是中文句子
Iran, for its part, has proclaimed Syria an indispensable ally, and is determined to prevent regime change there by all available means.	我是中文句子
Does that mean that Hezbollah’s militias in neighboring Lebanon will now become directly involved in Syria’s civil war?	我是中文句子
Would such intervention revive Lebanon’s own long civil war of the 1970’s and 1980’s?	我是中文句子
Is there a threat of a new Arab-Israeli war hanging over the Middle East?	我是中文句子
Indeed, parallel to the Syrian drama, the rhetoric in the confrontation between Israel and Iran over the program has become dramatically harsher.	我是中文句子
Both sides have maneuvered themselves into a dead-end.	我是中文句子
From the regime’s point of view, the legacy of the 1979 Islamic revolution is at stake.	我是中文句子
But the international sanctions are hurting, and Iran risks losing Syria.	我是中文句子
Everything points to the regime’s need for success – now more than ever – concerning its nuclear program.	我是中文句子
Similarly, Israel’s government has backed itself into a domestic policy trap of its own.	我是中文句子
They do not fear a nuclear attack against Israel, but rather a nuclear arms race in the region and a dramatic shift in power to Israel’s disadvantage.	我是中文句子
From their point of view, Israel must either convince the US to attack Iran and its nuclear plants or take on the maximum risk of using its own military forces to do so.	我是中文句子
Both sides have substantially reduced their options, thereby limiting the possibility of a diplomatic compromise.	我是中文句子
And that means that both sides have stopped thinking through the consequences of their actions.	我是中文句子
Everywhere there is talk of a “military option,” which means air strikes.	我是中文句子
And what if this “military option” fails?	我是中文句子
Iran, too, evidently has not thought its position through to its logical conclusion.	我是中文句子
What does it stand to gain from nuclear status if it comes at the cost of regional isolation and harsh United Nations sanctions for the foreseeable future?	我是中文句子
And what if it triggers a regional nuclear arms race?	我是中文句子
China, already in economic trouble, would be hit hardest, along with the whole of East Asia.	我是中文句子
With the US also economically weakened and facing a presidential election, America’s leadership ability would be seriously constricted.	我是中文句子
Respice finem!	我是中文句子
(“Consider the end”), the Romans used to say.	我是中文句子
World leaders need to take this timeless wisdom to heart.	我是中文句子
And that applies doubly to Europeans.	我是中文句子
It would be absurd if we had to suffer a real catastrophe again in order to understand what European integration has always been about.	我是中文句子
NATO’s New Frontier	我是中文句子
BRUSSELS – Last week, an American ship sailed into a Spanish naval base, making history.	我是中文句子
The arrival of the USS Donald Cook marks a step forward for NATO, for European security, and for transatlantic cooperation.	我是中文句子
It clearly demonstrates the strength of the bond between America and Europe in dealing with the complex and unpredictable security challenges of our age.	我是中文句子
In April 2012, at its summit in Chicago, NATO announced an interim capability as an operationally significant first step.	我是中文句子
Full capability is expected to be attained in the years ahead.	我是中文句子
The purpose of NATO’s missile-defense system is to defend Europe against a real threat.	我是中文句子
At least 30 countries around the world either have ballistic missiles or are trying to acquire them.	我是中文句子
In the future, other important components of the missile-defense system will include additional radars, sensors, and interceptors – and more ships.	我是中文句子
Already, thanks to the US European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense, NATO can rely on a powerful radar based in Turkey.	我是中文句子
Work has already begun on construction of a land-based interceptor and radar site in Romania.	我是中文句子
Poland has announced plans to build up its air and missile-defense capabilities.	我是中文句子
The Netherlands is upgrading four radar frigates to make them capable of missile defense, and has offered its Patriot anti-missile systems.	我是中文句子
So has Germany.	我是中文句子
The Netherlands, Germany, and the US have already deployed Patriot missiles on NATO’s southeastern border to help defend and protect Turkey from possible missile attacks from Syria.	我是中文句子
This makes NATO unique: it is the only multilateral organization that can combine the most complex systems from the world’s most capable countries to create an effective whole.	我是中文句子
Above all, this deployment is a step forward for transatlantic cooperation, because the US ships represent more than a military capability.	我是中文句子
Each one is an eight-thousand-ton reminder of America’s commitment to security in Europe.	我是中文句子
At the same time, NATO’s missile defense demonstrates European allies’ commitment to security as they develop their capabilities in this area.	我是中文句子
I encourage all allies to consider how they can contribute further to a system that will defend all of us in Europe.	我是中文句子
Missile defense heralds a new form of cooperation, with new capabilities against new threats.	我是中文句子
NATO’s missile-defense system is what transatlantic teamwork looks like in the twenty-first century.	我是中文句子
Antarctica’s Point of No Return	我是中文句子
The planet has entered a new era of irreversible consequences from climate change.	我是中文句子
The only question now is whether we will do enough to prevent similar developments elsewhere.	我是中文句子
What the latest findings demonstrate is that crucial parts of the world’s climate system, though massive in size, are so fragile that they can be irremediably disrupted by human activity.	我是中文句子
There are not many human activities whose impact can reasonably be predicted decades, centuries, or even millennia in advance.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the greater our emissions, the higher the seas will rise.	我是中文句子
But the recent revelations about Antarctica are different.	我是中文句子
A relatively small amount of melting beneath the Amundsen Sea’s ice shelf has pushed its grounding line to the top of a sub-glacial hill, from which it is now “rolling down.”	我是中文句子
But that is not the point.	我是中文句子
This risk is no longer merely theoretical.	我是中文句子
It has passed the point of no return.	我是中文句子
That is why we must now focus on similar topographic conditions elsewhere.	我是中文句子
If an “ice plug” near the coast of Wilkes Basin melts or breaks off into icebergs, the basin’s huge quantities of water will drain into the ocean.	我是中文句子
The fact that sea levels will continue to rise is now clear.	我是中文句子
But we can still determine how high and how fast levels rise by controlling the degree of global warming that we cause.	我是中文句子
Climate change is caused by mankind, so the good news is that mankind can stop it by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.	我是中文句子
Although West Antarctica’s fate is sealed, we may still be able to prevent the collapse of East Antarctica’s marine ice sheet.	我是中文句子
That means deciding – sooner rather than later – which path to follow.	我是中文句子
The current path risks further destabilization in Antarctica; choosing the alternative path of a new energy system for the planet is our last best hope.	我是中文句子
Reviving Ukraine’s Economy	我是中文句子
WASHINGTON, DC – Ukraine has suddenly arrived at a democratic breakthrough.	我是中文句子
Ukraine suffers from three large economic problems.	我是中文句子
First, its foreign payments are unsustainable.	我是中文句子
Second, public finances are also unsustainable, with the budget deficit reaching almost 8% of GDP and government-bond yields skyrocketing.	我是中文句子
Third, the economy has been in recession for five quarters since mid-2012.	我是中文句子
These problems reflect Yanukovych’s economic policy, which had one aim: enriching him, his family, and a few of his cronies.	我是中文句子
During the last four years, Ukraine has experienced unprecedented embezzlement by its rulers, with estimates putting the Yanukovych family’s wealth at $12 billion.	我是中文句子
Here, too, the new government will need international assistance if it is to recover at least some of this loot.	我是中文句子
With Yanukovych out of the way, official extortion of Ukrainian business should end, enabling the economy to recover.	我是中文句子
In fact, Ukraine’s GDP actually grew by 3.3% in the last quarter of 2013, because his cronyism was stifled by the protests.	我是中文句子
Yet much can and must be done very quickly, because Ukraine is running out of money.	我是中文句子
For starters, the new parliamentary majority needs to appoint a new government, so that a fresh economic-policy agenda can be launched.	我是中文句子
A new central bank governor also should be named, with the first order of business being to float the exchange rate.	我是中文句子
As soon as a government has been appointed, the International Monetary Fund should send a mission to Ukraine.	我是中文句子
Within two weeks, the IMF mission could conclude a new financial stabilization program with the new administration.	我是中文句子
The IMF works fast and could make a first large disbursement in late March.	我是中文句子
The conditions that the IMF places on its loans can help Ukraine undo Yanukovych’s venal policies.	我是中文句子
First and foremost, Ukraine will have to reduce its budget deficit sharply, which, given large tax revenues, should be accomplished through expenditure cuts and freezes.	我是中文句子
Likewise, gas prices should be liberalized to stop corrupt enrichment from regulatory arbitrage.	我是中文句子
Needy consumers, not wealthy producers, should receive assistance.	我是中文句子
Similarly, the IMF will insist on the reintroduction of competitive tenders.	我是中文句子
Since 2010, orderly public procurement has ceased, with Yanukovych simply doling out state contracts to friends and acolytes at twice the market price.	我是中文句子
Naturally, sales of state enterprises to loyalists – typically at rock-bottom prices – must end as well.	我是中文句子
Another source of corruption has been refunds of value-added tax for exporters, for which top tax officials charge a commission.	我是中文句子
Putting a stop to this would stimulate exports.	我是中文句子
In addition, Ukraine should reintroduce the simplified tax code for small businesses that Yanukovych abolished.	我是中文句子
Two million small enterprises were wiped out by that change; many of them could be revived if tax procedures were no longer prohibitive.	我是中文句子
Ukraine also needs to work with the EU.	我是中文句子
Within a week, the new government can fulfill the EU’s conditions for signing the long-concluded Association Agreement, and doing so should be on the agenda at the EU-Ukraine summit in March.	我是中文句子
The only remaining EU condition – legislation reforming the prosecutor’s office – can be adopted quickly.	我是中文句子
The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement will greatly benefit Ukraine.	我是中文句子
It amounts to a comprehensive reform program for the Ukrainian state apparatus, including its law-enforcement bodies.	我是中文句子
Sixty state agencies in various EU countries have already concluded agreements with their Ukrainian counterparts concerning the necessary reforms.	我是中文句子
This will also help to safeguard the country against possible Russian trade sanctions.	我是中文句子
Here, diplomacy will play an important role as well.	我是中文句子
Peaceful co-existence, not mounting bilateral tension, is in both countries’ best interest.	我是中文句子
And Free Flows the Nile	我是中文句子
After all, Egypt is the heart, brain, and nerve center of the Arab world.	我是中文句子
Pernicious talk that Arabs do not want democracy has been exposed as the big lie it is.	我是中文句子
Ancient Arab lands are bestirred.	我是中文句子
Decades-old, apparently immovable autocracies are finding their hold on power unhinged; change is invading their static environs.	我是中文句子
Yesterday’s treaties, particularly those with the United States and Israel, will no longer inspire the same type of confidence they have long had as instruments of state policy.	我是中文句子
Will this yearning travel beyond the Nile, as it did from Tunis to Cairo?	我是中文句子
This question haunts other Arab portals of power.	我是中文句子
And not just Arab; globally, foreign policies are being hurriedly – and somewhat confusedly – revised and rewritten.	我是中文句子
Of course, a grave question arises about the now-ruling Supreme Council of the Military High Command in Egypt: How can the enforcers of the status quo become the agents of change?	我是中文句子
But, then, military rule is only a temporary measure, or so we reason.	我是中文句子
Their idiom is current; their instruments of change are today’s electronic media.	我是中文句子
They – and we – are very far from the world that Mubarak, or the great Gamal Abdel Nasser, knew and understood.	我是中文句子
The Egyptian revolution now faces the exacting task that confronts all successful revolutions: how to define the future.	我是中文句子
Like the Ottoman Empire’s fragmentation in 1922 or Nasser’s overthrow of King Farouk’s regime in 1952, the current transformation, too, must be shaped.	我是中文句子
And how that future is shaped will determine whether or not Mubarak’s end marks the beginning of political transformation throughout the Middle East.	我是中文句子
That is the possibility that is shaking governments from Washington to Beijing.	我是中文句子
It is not just the reliability of the Suez Canal and oil exports that are now in doubt; decades of fixed strategic certainties must now be reexamined.	我是中文句子
That strategic nightmare cost Israel and the US their closest ally in the region, one that was soon transformed into an implacable enemy.	我是中文句子
Clearly, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations will also now lie unattended as Israel concentrates on developments in Egypt.	我是中文句子
Above all, Israel must wonder if the peace treaty with Egypt will hold, and, if not, how to carry out the massive restructuring of its defense posture that will be required.	我是中文句子
But it is not only the fate of Israel that has now shocked US policy, in particular, to its core.	我是中文句子
Egypt, after all, has been the cornerstone of America’s balancing act in the Middle East – and the Islamic world – for three decades.	我是中文句子
The Egypt-Israel peace treaty has kept Egypt comfortably neutralized, freeing the US to commit its strategic resources elsewhere.	我是中文句子
In turn, Egypt, propped up by massive US aid, has secured the region from a larger conflagration, even though the Israel-Palestine conflict has continued to smolder.	我是中文句子
Herein lies the core of the dilemma for the US: it wants Egypt’s basic state apparatus to survive, so that the levers of power do not fall into the wrong hands.	我是中文句子
This requires the US to be seen as siding with the public’s demand for change, yet to avoid being identified with political immobility.	我是中文句子
There is reason to feel reassured by Obama’s reactions.	我是中文句子
Running in Place	我是中文句子
Once he takes office in 2010, the economy recovers quickly from the global financial crisis, creates jobs, and continues growing until recently.	我是中文句子
The billionaire, never one to shy from publicity, claims the credit.	我是中文句子
He is wrong.	我是中文句子
The Chilean economy has expanded, and no one with his or her heart in the right place can fail to celebrate that; but this growth has little to do with the former president’s policies.	我是中文句子
Even worse, the expansion is proving to be unsustainable, and Chileans will soon feel the consequences of Piñera’s failure to carry out the pro-growth reforms he once promised.	我是中文句子
Chile was hit hard by the 2008-2009 financial crisis: foreign loans vanished and the price of copper, Chile’s main export, collapsed.	我是中文句子
But this time around, the Chilean economy was in shape to withstand massive external shocks.	我是中文句子
The government had been running surpluses, public debt was almost nil, and banks were well regulated.	我是中文句子
The central bank, autonomous from political pressures and run by highly respected professionals, did its part by slashing interest rates.	我是中文句子
In Europe, the recession has lasted six years and counting; in Chile, it lasted ten months.	我是中文句子
Tough regulation and record-low interest rates left companies and households with no debt overhang and little need to deleverage.	我是中文句子
By late 2009, the Chilean economy was growing again, and in the years since, growth has been helped by highly propitious external conditions.	我是中文句子
Piñera blamed the incoming Bachelet administration, and its plan to raise taxes, for the drop in the growth rate.	我是中文句子
The export basket of economically diversified countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, and Ireland is entirely different from what it was a generation ago.	我是中文句子
By contrast, Chile’s export basket has remained unchanged.	我是中文句子
In 1984, Chile exported copper and other minerals, paper and pulp, fruits and wine, fishmeal, and a smattering of light manufactures.	我是中文句子
Thirty years later, Chile’s exports comprise the same items.	我是中文句子
Investment in energy would probably take off – if only Chile’s institutions were modernized to make that possible.	我是中文句子
This is another area where Piñera’s legacy is wanting.	我是中文句子
Chile is unique among its neighbors in having no oil or gas.	我是中文句子
Chileans today pay the highest electricity rates in the region, because generating capacity has failed to keep pace with rising demand.	我是中文句子
A prolonged dry spell could cause the lights to go off in the next few years.	我是中文句子
Ensuring both cheaper energy and a clean environment is a big challenge.	我是中文句子
Regrettably, Piñera took action in none of these areas.	我是中文句子
Employment policy was yet another shortcoming of his administration.	我是中文句子
But these are all politically sensitive areas, where the smallest legal change can elicit howls of opposition.	我是中文句子
Piñera took the safe route of attempting no changes at all.	我是中文句子
And, of course, those young Chileans will have better prospects of getting a job if they come equipped with a first-rate education.	我是中文句子
Piñera’s government became embroiled in a fight with protesting students over who should pay for university education.	我是中文句子
That controversy prevented most other changes in education from going forward.	我是中文句子
Bachelet has vowed to end this paralysis and make educational reform her administration’s top priority.	我是中文句子
The goal is laudable, but achieving it will not be easy.	我是中文句子
Every year, Chile’s finance ministry asks a group of independent experts how fast Chile can grow without triggering inflation or other imbalances.	我是中文句子
In 2008, before Chile felt the consequences of the financial crisis, the average answer provided by those experts was 4.83%.	我是中文句子
In 2013, after three years of center-right government in Chile, the corresponding answer was ...4.85%.	我是中文句子
Under Piñera’s government, pro-growth rhetoric was abundant.	我是中文句子
But rhetoric alone cannot boost an economy’s growth trajectory.	我是中文句子
One Hundred Days of Solitude	我是中文句子
The situation was up to Venezuela to sort out, the OAS stated.	我是中文句子
Foreign ministers from other Latin American countries are nowhere to be seen in Caracas – certainly not denouncing repression and demanding an end to the violence.	我是中文句子
Meanwhile, the body count keeps rising.	我是中文句子
The contrast highlights what everyone already knows: Latin America’s regional institutions are weak – even weaker than Europe’s.	我是中文句子
It was not always like this.	我是中文句子
Not long ago in Latin America, life and liberty were deemed to be universal rights, to be defended across national borders.	我是中文句子
My father was a Chilean lawyer and human-rights activist.	我是中文句子
Everything has changed, yet everything remains the same.	我是中文句子
Yes, the situation in Venezuela must be sorted out by Venezuelans.	我是中文句子
The problem is that some Venezuelans today cannot march peacefully on the streets without being shot at.	我是中文句子
Some Venezuelans cannot speak freely to their fellow citizens, because each and every television station that would carry their words has been muzzled or driven off the air.	我是中文句子
And some Venezuelans cannot be sure their rights will be respected.	我是中文句子
Venezuelans would like nothing better than to be the ones who decide their own destiny, but the democratic means to do so are being denied to them.	我是中文句子
Indeed, one of the key opposition leaders, Leopoldo López, has been arrested on ludicrous charges of “inciting crime.”	我是中文句子
It would have been preposterous to tell Ukrainian demonstrators facing government storm troopers to just grin and bear it without any external solidarity or support.	我是中文句子
It is just as preposterous to tell Venezuelan demonstrators the same thing.	我是中文句子
In these circumstances, the principle of self-determination, so beloved of foreign ministries everywhere, becomes an empty slogan.	我是中文句子
Perhaps the saddest of all foreign reactions came from the University of Chile’s student federation.	我是中文句子
The problem with this argument (if one can call it that) is that “the people” do not speak with one voice, nor do their pronouncements fall fully formed from the sky.	我是中文句子
To figure out what real people actually want and respond accordingly, democracies have procedures, constitutional guarantees, and individual rights.	我是中文句子
It is equally silly to argue that Maduro’s actions must be legitimate because he came to power through an election.	我是中文句子
A democratically elected leader retains legitimacy only to the extent that he or she behaves democratically once in office.	我是中文句子
Venezuelans, like Ukrainians, should know that they are not alone.	我是中文句子
Their struggle for democratic rights is everyone’s struggle.	我是中文句子
People in Latin America know this, even if their leaders are not always willing to say it out loud.	我是中文句子
Industrial Policy Reconsidered	我是中文句子
SANTIAGO – First, the World Bank became a tireless advocate of women’s and gay rights.	我是中文句子
Then the International Monetary Fund backed the use of capital controls and voiced concern over income inequality.	我是中文句子
Next in line for ideological modernization is the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB): in a forthcoming report, the bank calls for industrial policies in Latin America.	我是中文句子
This is a welcome development.	我是中文句子
Yet the message is clear: in Latin America, the state and public policy should have a role in deciding what gets produced.	我是中文句子
A generation ago, this message would have been heretical.	我是中文句子
Today, it is a matter of common sense.	我是中文句子
Last week, economists from the IADB brought their gospel to a conference in Santiago, Chile.	我是中文句子
The country, for decades the region’s poster-child for good economic management, is also an example of the risks that all Latin American economies face.	我是中文句子
With commodity prices falling and dollar interest rates on the rise, Chilean growth is slowing sharply.	我是中文句子
Productivity gains have been sluggish for nearly 15 years, and the country’s export basket is the same as it was in the 1980’s.	我是中文句子
Chile’s growth problems are among the least severe in the region.	我是中文句子
As the IADB has pointed out in several earlier reports, productivity has been stagnant in most of Latin America for a half-century or more.	我是中文句子
What is to be done?	我是中文句子
To this standard tool kit the IADB now adds PDPs, which can be “horizontal” or “vertical.”	我是中文句子
Horizontal PDPs provide the inputs that a broad range of firms, across different sectors, need for their growth and development.	我是中文句子
Simple examples include transport infrastructure, trained engineers, and a labor force proficient in English.	我是中文句子
More sophisticated examples can involve systems for health and safety inspection, product-quality certification, or intellectual-property protection.	我是中文句子
The problem is that some of these publicly provided inputs can be sector- or product-specific.	我是中文句子
Roads to remote and beautiful mountains foster eco-tourism but do not help carry merchandise to the nearest port.	我是中文句子
A lab built to certify that beef does not have foot-and-mouth disease is of little use in verifying that fruit and vegetable exports are similarly disease-free.	我是中文句子
That is where vertical policies – those that favor a particular sector – come in.	我是中文句子
But, as the examples given above suggest, the line between horizontal and vertical policies is inevitably fuzzy.	我是中文句子
The IADB argues that it is better to do this consciously, transparently, and with the appropriate checks and balances.	我是中文句子
Vertical policies are also useful in solving coordination failures.	我是中文句子
Consider the tourism industry, which has great potential in the beautiful Patagonia region of southern Argentina and Chile.	我是中文句子
But no private firm will build a hotel in this remote, under-populated region if no road leads there.	我是中文句子
By the same token, no government official will build a road if there are no hotels or lodges, for the road would lead nowhere.	我是中文句子
Without deliberate private-public coordination focused on tourism, the sector may never take off.	我是中文句子
Skeptics also point out that Latin America already went through a round of industrial policy in the 1960’s and 1970’s, with results that were mediocre at best.	我是中文句子
The IADB report provides a balanced assessment of that episode.	我是中文句子
Worse, government help was handed out to strong and weak performers alike.	我是中文句子
In Asia, many firms that initially received help sooner or later became world-class competitors.	我是中文句子
In Latin America, with little market and policy discipline and chronically overvalued exchange rates, that transition seldom happened.	我是中文句子
To be sure, those problems had to be corrected.	我是中文句子
More and more, the question is not put in terms of whether to do active productive development policies but rather how to do them.”	我是中文句子
Unlike 1960’s-vintage industrial policy, modern PDPs aim to correct market failures, not do away with market incentives.	我是中文句子
Market failure is not the only issue.	我是中文句子
The emerging new approach to PDPs is also fearful of state failure.	我是中文句子
State agencies can be captured and aid can be used for private or political gain.	我是中文句子
To prevent this, the report again usefully deviates from reigning orthodoxy, which tells countries to identify and copy “best practices” from abroad.	我是中文句子
This approach cannot succeed if such practices require what local government cannot deliver.	我是中文句子
Hence, “the focus ought to be not on policy best practices but on policy best matches with institutional capabilities.”	我是中文句子
Latin America will need a great deal of fresh thinking and many policy innovations if it is to keep growing in a post-commodity-boom era.	我是中文句子
No policy is failure-proof.	我是中文句子
But the approach advocated in the forthcoming IADB report is the region’s best hope today.	我是中文句子
Dead Cow Walking?	我是中文句子
Surely he would understand that no community can be built on so fragmented a foundation.	我是中文句子
Peru has gas, which it sells to Mexico.	我是中文句子
Bolivia also has gas, but it has been under-exploiting it ever since it nationalized the industry in 2006.	我是中文句子
Argentina used to have a gas industry, but it was decimated by years of misguided government policies.	我是中文句子
Brazil discovered hydrocarbons deep in the Atlantic Ocean a few years ago and has begun auctioning off rights, but actual production is still years away.	我是中文句子
Chile has no oil or gas, and no one in the neighborhood will sell it any, so it has to buy its supplies from as far away as Indonesia.	我是中文句子
Moreover, South America’s electricity grids are seldom interconnected, and rates for power vary widely.	我是中文句子
Brazil and Chile have the region’s highest electricity prices (which are also among the highest in the world).	我是中文句子
The competitiveness of their industries, and consumers’ household budgets, suffer accordingly.	我是中文句子
Or, if they are signed, they are often broken when compelling short-term considerations intervene.	我是中文句子
For example, a decade ago, contracts promising a steady supply of Argentine gas at pre-set prices led Chile to spend billions refitting its power stations.	我是中文句子
But, after a long period of price controls and massive underinvestment, domestic demand in Argentina was far outpacing supply.	我是中文句子
But now a new and powerful factor could change this dismal political equation: shale gas, which is already having an important effect on the United States and its economy.	我是中文句子
The impact of shale energy on South America is twofold.	我是中文句子
For starters, there is the potential for cheaper imports for those countries with no gas (Chile) or where local demand could exceed local supply (Brazil).	我是中文句子
Then there is the shale gas to be exploited closer to home.	我是中文句子
Argentina reportedly has the world’s third-largest shale-gas reserves, after the US and China.	我是中文句子
The huge Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, owned by the energy company YPF, is just now beginning to be explored.	我是中文句子
But, with Argentina and Repsol recently reaching a settlement, interest has revived.	我是中文句子
Surely, the technical challenges of exploiting such shale-gas reserves are huge, and only a handful of firms in the world have the necessary knowhow.	我是中文句子
The financial challenges are even greater: analysts speak of tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in required investment.	我是中文句子
But the potential for Argentina and the region is tremendous.	我是中文句子
But, because world prices are likely to drop fast as the US steps up exports, Argentina has to act quickly in order to capture these potential gains.	我是中文句子
Sturzenegger has called the decision about shale gas “the most important” in Argentina’s economic history.	我是中文句子
Argentina’s choices could matter not just for the region’s economy, but also for its politics.	我是中文句子
The shift in the regional balance of gas-based power could in turn cause nationalists in Bolivia, Peru, and elsewhere to rethink their policies.	我是中文句子
Integration in the oil, gas, and other energy industries, along with the interconnection of national power grids, could follow.	我是中文句子
South America’s economic and political landscape would be changed forever.	我是中文句子
Is this too optimistic?	我是中文句子
Perhaps.	我是中文句子
The political and legal safeguards needed to make energy flows safe and reliable would have to be built.	我是中文句子
As the region’s history shows, that is no easy task.	我是中文句子
Time and again, nationalism and shortsighted politics have trumped reason.	我是中文句子
But the stakes are so high, and the potential so great, that the least one must do is hope.	我是中文句子
Mercosur Blues	我是中文句子
SANTIAGO – When the leaders of Mercosur met in Caracas this week, the usual bluster about standing up to imperialism filled the air.	我是中文句子
But so did the unmistakable scent of decay.	我是中文句子
Mercosur is usually described as a trade grouping; in fact, it has been a political creation from the start.	我是中文句子
Brazil, the regional powerhouse, always viewed it as a counterweight to the United States in hemispheric affairs.	我是中文句子
Peronist governments in Argentina used it to hype integration while doing little or nothing to remove actual barriers to trade.	我是中文句子
With the entrance of Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela in 2006, the lurch toward populism became unmistakable.	我是中文句子
They were long on posturing and endless speeches, but short on substantive agreements about anything.	我是中文句子
Bolivia, also governed by a charismatic populist, was keen to develop closer ties.	我是中文句子
Ecuador soon followed suit.	我是中文句子
And a smattering of smaller countries in Central America and the Caribbean fell into political line in exchange for generous infusions of Venezuelan cash and oil.	我是中文句子
Back then, Mercosur leaders could claim to offer an “alternative development model” for the region.	我是中文句子
No more.	我是中文句子
This week in Caracas, the mood was funereal.	我是中文句子
The host, Chávez’s successor Nicolás Maduro, confronts a collapsing economy and tensions within his own party.	我是中文句子
Despite relatively high oil prices, Venezuela has a large fiscal deficit and falling foreign-exchange reserves.	我是中文句子
The inflation rate is the region’s highest, and the economy is stagnating.	我是中文句子
In the face of popular frustration with worsening living conditions, Maduro’s government has relied on violent repression to put an end to street protests.	我是中文句子
Opposition leader Leopoldo López spent months in a military prison before recently being put on trial.	我是中文句子
Institutions like Human Rights Watch have repeatedly denounced the government’s rights violations and restrictions on civil liberties.	我是中文句子
But Fernández found that her colleagues’ polite words of encouragement mattered little.	我是中文句子
The US Supreme Court’s decision last month to uphold a lower court’s ruling against Argentina put her in an impossible situation.	我是中文句子
She chose the latter option.	我是中文句子
Access to foreign capital matters for Fernández, because, like Maduro, she faces a stalled economy and a growing dollar shortage.	我是中文句子
Domestic stabilization measures earlier this year bought her some time, yet fear of a recession remains.	我是中文句子
In Bolivia, President Evo Morales has resorted to legal and constitutional shenanigans to guarantee himself yet another term in office.	我是中文句子
After two terms, Morales would in theory be prohibited from running again.	我是中文句子
In Ecuador, too, democratic institutions are under siege.	我是中文句子
An independent report has chronicled 12 separate episodes of government meddling with court rulings.	我是中文句子
A controversial gag law on the press that was enacted last year has already ended a major newspaper’s print edition.	我是中文句子
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff faces a situation that is both similar to and different from that of her Mercosur colleagues.	我是中文句子
Brazil is not the kind of country where a president can manipulate the constitution or close newspapers at will.	我是中文句子
But malaise is in the air in Brasilia (leaving aside the World Cup thrashing delivered by Germany).	我是中文句子
Despite low unemployment, economic anxiety is on the rise – and is beginning to filter to the political realm.	我是中文句子
Absent from the Caracas summit was Chile’s president, Michelle Bachelet, who blamed a cold and a busy domestic agenda for her inability to travel.	我是中文句子
Political complications linked to a possible meeting with the Venezuelan opposition, which Bachelet had chosen not to attend (preferring to send her foreign minister), likely also played a part.	我是中文句子
Rousseff and Bachelet were natural candidates to lead the development of a moderate counterweight to the populism of Maduro, Fernández, Morales, and Correa.	我是中文句子
Chile is too small to go it alone, and Bachelet has her hands full with increasingly controversial tax, education, and constitutional reforms.	我是中文句子
Uruguay’s president, José Mujica, offered the best summary of what happened in Caracas: “We issued a statement.”	我是中文句子
In other words, Mercosur remains an irrelevant talking shop – and the emergence of a modern center-left regional leadership in Latin America will have to wait.	我是中文句子
The Third Way's Second Chance	我是中文句子
SANTIAGO – Remember Tony Blair and Bill Clinton’s Third Way?	我是中文句子
It is back.	我是中文句子
At a June 2000 gathering of leaders in Berlin, hosted by Germany’s then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, the Third Way seemed like the way of the future.	我是中文句子
The gathering was Blair’s brainchild (though he did not attend because his wife had just had a child).	我是中文句子
But Clinton held forth eloquently on how new technologies could help to solve age-old social ills.	我是中文句子
Leaders from Sweden and New Zealand argued that you could make the state both leaner and more effective.	我是中文句子
Sadly, it was not to last.	我是中文句子
Al Gore traded Clintonomics for traditional populism and was defeated by George W. Bush.	我是中文句子
Social democrats and their allies lost power in several European countries.	我是中文句子
The war in Iraq and the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 caused a backlash against some of the policies advocated by Third Way leaders.	我是中文句子
Fast forward to the present.	我是中文句子
Italy’s 39-year-old socialist prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is often described as his country’s last hope.	我是中文句子
He is promising (though not quite yet delivering) deep labor-market and fiscal reforms.	我是中文句子
Critics from the orthodox left accuse him of “taking solutions from Blair and Schröder.”	我是中文句子
With the world economy growing slowly, many center-left politicians are trying to mobilize markets and jump-start growth while investing in jobs and skills.	我是中文句子
Thus, dire need is the immediate explanation for the return of Third Way ideas.	我是中文句子
It is not surprising that deeply indebted European governments are casting about for new social policies at a low fiscal cost.	我是中文句子
But the harsh austerity advocated by Germany’s conservative government is not the same as the gradual adjustment sought by the new generation of Southern social democrats.	我是中文句子
Conservatives demand fiscal adjustment up front, whatever the consequences.	我是中文句子
Modern social democrats who have read their Keynes understand that some immediate adjustment is necessary to make the program credible.	我是中文句子
The other reason for giving Third Way ideas a second hearing is that they work.	我是中文句子
The result: they have achieved the trifecta of robust growth, high employment, and low public debt.	我是中文句子
The effectiveness of these ideas is not limited to the rich countries of the North.	我是中文句子
All had (or have) their share of controversies.	我是中文句子
But each undeniably launched an unprecedented period of democratic consolidation and economic modernization in their respective countries.	我是中文句子
In Brazil’s upcoming presidential election, both of the incumbent Dilma Rousseff’s main opponents are advocating policies that hark back to the good old days.	我是中文句子
In the case of Aécio Neves, who belongs to Cardoso’s party, that is not surprising.	我是中文句子
Blair, who gave the Bank of England its full independence during his first week in office, would be proud.	我是中文句子
There are many differences across countries and time, but in the end four ideas are common to these successful experiences.	我是中文句子
The first is policy pragmatism.	我是中文句子
What matters is what works, not what is ideologically pure.	我是中文句子
The second idea is fiscal realism.	我是中文句子
The third idea is modern welfarism.	我是中文句子
The state can and should redistribute income and wealth, but in doing so it should not weaken incentives to work and to save.	我是中文句子
Instead of simply providing handouts, governments should strive to guarantee good jobs at good wages.	我是中文句子
Finally, the Third Way is defined by progressive liberalism.	我是中文句子
Liberty and equality are complementary, not contradictory, principles.	我是中文句子
If the rules are designed properly, a society in which people decide and act freely can also be a society in which opportunities are fairly distributed.	我是中文句子
And conversely, without minimum opportunity for all, liberty is more illusory than real.	我是中文句子
The Lawless Sea	我是中文句子
SANTIAGO – The rule of law is almost entirely absent, with virtually no governance or policing.	我是中文句子
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated economic activities are common.	我是中文句子
The powerful seize non-renewable resources at the expense of the powerless.	我是中文句子
Environmental degradation is on the rise.	我是中文句子
That may sound like a description of a failed state, a desperately poor country beset by civil war, or a fictional dystopia.	我是中文句子
But it is none of the above.	我是中文句子
How is this possible?	我是中文句子
When UNCLOS was negotiated, the high seas were protected because they were inaccessible.	我是中文句子
But technological advances have enabled the exploitation of resources to extend farther and deeper than ever before.	我是中文句子
Fishing vessels can now operate across the ocean, and deep-sea drilling provides a growing proportion of our oil and gas.	我是中文句子
UNCLOS has not kept pace with these developments.	我是中文句子
Industries and activities such as fisheries, shipping, and seabed mining are all regulated separately.	我是中文句子
No governance framework is in place for emerging high-seas industries such as energy production.	我是中文句子
Transparency and accountability are weak, and there is little enforcement of rules.	我是中文句子
Moreover, the authorities have limited power to intercept vessels suspected of illegal activity.	我是中文句子
As a result, international cooperation to counter illegal fishing, smuggling of weapons and drugs, human trafficking, piracy, and the use of vessels in terrorist operations has been greatly hampered.	我是中文句子
The consequences are dire.	我是中文句子
The ocean is our planet’s life-support-system, keeping it healthy and productive.	我是中文句子
But overfishing and pollution are causing tremendous damage.	我是中文句子
Plastic pollution – including pellets and micro plastics that enter food chains and can endanger human health – is a growing problem.	我是中文句子
Likewise, rising temperatures are reducing the ocean's oxygen-carrying capacity.	我是中文句子
The increasing uptake of carbon dioxide is causing ocean acidification and unprecedented changes in chemical and physical conditions, which in turn are affecting marine organisms and ecosystems.	我是中文句子
The very life of the global ocean is under threat.	我是中文句子
That is the purpose behind the Global Ocean Commission, an independent international body comprising former heads of state, ministers, and business leaders.	我是中文句子
I am one of the commissioners.	我是中文句子
Last week, we proposed a rescue package that offers eight proposals to improve governance and restore ocean health.	我是中文句子
Less than 1% of the high seas is currently protected, so it is crucial that this new agreement includes provisions for creating protected areas in the high seas.	我是中文句子
Without subsidies, high-seas fisheries would not be financially viable.	我是中文句子
By closing loopholes, we will finally close our ports and markets to illegally obtained fish.	我是中文句子
We can reverse ocean degradation, and turn the cycle of decline into a cycle of renewal.	我是中文句子
We know what needs to be done to restore ocean health, but we cannot do it alone.	我是中文句子
Delivering change will take political will and require joint efforts by governments, businesses, and civil society.	我是中文句子
It can and must be done.	我是中文句子
Join our mission at http://missionocean.me.	我是中文句子
The time to act is now.	我是中文句子
The more the global ocean struggles for life, the more our children and future generations will struggle for theirs.	我是中文句子
Argentina’s Use and Abuse of Keynes	我是中文句子
Today, Axel Kicillof, Argentina’s Peronist economy minister, is echoing this sentiment.	我是中文句子
Is he right?	我是中文句子
In an hour-long speech, he made two key points.	我是中文句子
Is this logic at work in Argentina?	我是中文句子
When the Argentine economy imploded in 2001, citizens lost their jobs and firms lost their access to credit, causing domestic demand to collapse.	我是中文句子
Output fell sharply.	我是中文句子
But, as the country abandoned the one-to-one currency peg to the US dollar, the real exchange rate depreciated.	我是中文句子
This shifted demand away from imports toward domestically produced goods.	我是中文句子
Given Argentina’s isolation from world financial markets, its central bank could cut domestic interest rates with limited fear of capital flight.	我是中文句子
The fiscal and monetary impulse supported a rapid recovery.	我是中文句子
At first glance, Kicillof seems to be correct; this looks like textbook Keynesian reflation.	我是中文句子
A Keynesian approach would ensure that demand does not fall short of supply.	我是中文句子
The Kirchners have made sure that demand far exceeds supply.	我是中文句子
Kicillof’s second point was that Argentina’s businesses and consumers should not succumb to pessimism.	我是中文句子
Alluding to Keynes’s theories about self-fulfilling expectations, he warned that, if people expect things to go wrong, they will.	我是中文句子
Shifts in expectations can thus alter the outcome.	我是中文句子
But Argentines are not pessimistic about the economy because other Argentines are pessimistic.	我是中文句子
They are pessimistic because the economy’s fundamentals are weak – a fundamental difference.	我是中文句子
A couple of years ago, the eurozone was in the latter situation.	我是中文句子
That is why European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s pledge to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro immediately brought the eurozone’s debt crisis to a halt.	我是中文句子
(The growth crisis, of course, has yet to be resolved.)	我是中文句子
But Argentina is not the eurozone.	我是中文句子
There is nothing that Kicillof could say today that would have the soothing effect that Draghi’s promise did.	我是中文句子
Argentines today feel much like Dorothy did when she first landed in Oz – they are not in the safe and familiar “Kansas” anymore.	我是中文句子
But Keynes is not to blame. Kicillof and Kirchner are.	我是中文句子
Monsieur Piketty Goes to Latin America	我是中文句子
SANTIAGO – Few things excite intellectuals of the old Latin American left like a book on inequality written by a Frenchman.	我是中文句子
Piketty weaves a grand narrative about the dynamics of capital accumulation in a market economy.	我是中文句子
No one can deny that the distribution of income is scandalously unequal in Latin America.	我是中文句子
Piketty’s theory concerns what economists call the functional distribution of income, or the split between providers of labor and owners of capital.	我是中文句子
But the maldistribution that causes so much unease in Latin America concerns the personal distribution of labor income – that is, the split among wage earners.	我是中文句子
For example, the results from the 2009 CASEN, Chile’s broad-ranging household survey, suggest that capital income is more equally distributed than labor income.	我是中文句子
No one in his right mind should believe this, of course.	我是中文句子
All this result shows is that owners of stocks and bonds tend to lie to government surveyors.	我是中文句子
That, in turn, reveals two bits of information – both grim – about income distribution in Latin America.	我是中文句子
Second, even if all of the capital dynamics that so concern Piketty could be wished away, the distribution of income in Latin America would still be appallingly skewed.	我是中文句子
And the cure for that maldistribution does not lie just in the sizeable wealth taxes that Piketty advocates.	我是中文句子
Why not?	我是中文句子
Surely, if labor income is skewed, redistributing capital income or assets to the poor can boost overall equality.	我是中文句子
But the paper also offers a reminder that there are limits to how much income the tax system can redistribute.	我是中文句子
Of course, real-life redistributions, at least in Latin America, are much smaller than that.	我是中文句子
Even if none of that money leaks and all is redistributed to poorer Chileans, the reform is unlikely to lower the Gini score by more than three points.	我是中文句子
Turning Chile and some of its neighbors into countries with OECD levels of equality will require a great deal more than tax reform.	我是中文句子
Three main tools are available for improving the pre-distribution of income.	我是中文句子
First, education reform – with a strong emphasis on technical training – would endow low-income citizens with new skills that they could supply in the labor market.	我是中文句子
Second, targeted industrial policy would create the demand for those workers and their newly acquired skills.	我是中文句子
And, third, modernization of labor markets would lead to more efficient matching of workers’ skills and firms’ special needs in a context of growing heterogeneity.	我是中文句子
These policies are not substitutes but complements: they must all be undertaken at the same time.	我是中文句子
Doing so is not easy.	我是中文句子
In Latin America, center-left political leaders, concerned as they are with economic and social justice, will have to fashion their own country-specific approaches.	我是中文句子
There is no ready-made recipe awaiting them in a French economist’s magnum opus.	我是中文句子
The High Cost of Ocean Decline	我是中文句子
SANTIAGO – The world’s oceans are in trouble.	我是中文句子
Ocean degradation is not as visible as deforestation, but it is at least as dangerous.	我是中文句子
The oceans provide at least half of the oxygen we breathe.	我是中文句子
They absorb more carbon dioxide than forests do.	我是中文句子
Harm to the oceans can have a tremendous global impact.	我是中文句子
Degradation is particularly serious in the one substantial part of the world that is governed internationally – the high seas.	我是中文句子
These waters are outside maritime states’ exclusive economic zones; they comprise two-thirds of the oceans’ area, covering fully 45% of the earth’s surface.	我是中文句子
Next year, it will produce a set of recommendations concerning how to restore our oceans to full health and ecological productivity.	我是中文句子
One of the first tasks is to quantify the economic losses caused by ocean degradation.	我是中文句子
But these figures are nearly a decade old; the Commission will update these estimates and make them more precise.	我是中文句子
It is not enough to document that the losses are big.	我是中文句子
Obviously, the next question is what to do about it.	我是中文句子
No single official body has overall responsibility for the high seas.	我是中文句子
So, even if the economic losses turn out to be much higher than previous estimates, there are currently few effective mechanisms to bring about change.	我是中文句子
Since then, huge technological advances have occurred, and demand for resources has increased massively.	我是中文句子
Here the experience of countries fighting against deforestation is helpful.	我是中文句子
Costa Rica arguably started a trend in the early 1990’s, when it began levying taxes on fossil fuels and using the revenue to protect forests.	我是中文句子
The net result was a reversal of deforestation.	我是中文句子
The economy has benefited directly through a growth in tourism, and indirectly by preserving ecosystem services such as pollination.	我是中文句子
The concept of payment for ecosystem services is currently receiving attention from governments around the world.	我是中文句子
Costa Rica and Colombia have both signed up to a program funded by donor governments.	我是中文句子
Brazil has schemes that pay for protecting watercourses.	我是中文句子
These ideas should receive more attention in the future, as our supplies of non-renewable resources dwindle.	我是中文句子
When the Global Ocean Commission issues its recommendations for reform next year, economics will be at their heart.	我是中文句子
Once we have more accurate data on the value of the ocean, we must decide how we use this information.	我是中文句子
Payment for ecosystem services could be a solution, though there are likely to be simpler options.	我是中文句子
But whichever mechanism is eventually adopted, we must also address the governance question: today’s inadequate system allows both economic and ecological losses to persist.	我是中文句子
The Commission will share its recommendations with governments.	我是中文句子
There are tremendous costs associated with allowing the current laissez-faire regime to continue.	我是中文句子
Secular Stagnation Heads South	我是中文句子
The region’s main economies recorded slower GDP growth in 2013, and much the same is being forecast for 2014.	我是中文句子
So the “natural” rate of interest – the rate at which the demand for investment equals the supply of savings – has fallen, and arguably has become negative.	我是中文句子
But, because real interest rates cannot be strongly negative unless inflation is high (which it is not), there is a savings glut.	我是中文句子
With consumption and investment lagging, the US economy is bound to stagnate.	我是中文句子
But how could such a situation apply to Latin America, where GDP growth is faster, interest rates are higher, and domestic demand is stronger than in the US?	我是中文句子
Consider the region’s history.	我是中文句子
Until the recent commodity-driven boomlet, growth in Latin America was mediocre.	我是中文句子
So meager growth in the coming years would be a return to Latin America’s historical pattern, not a deviation from it.	我是中文句子
That brings us back to secular stagnation.	我是中文句子
Yes, Latin American countries’ average per capita GDP is only one-quarter that of the US, so they should be growing faster than their rich northern neighbor.	我是中文句子
The question is how much faster.	我是中文句子
Stagnation in this context means a growth rate that is too low to ensure convergence toward US living standards within a reasonable period of time.	我是中文句子
Unlike the US, Latin American economies’ actual output is at or near potential, so growing more means investing more.	我是中文句子
Yet investment has been disappointing.	我是中文句子
And the region’s problem is not too much domestic savings, but too little.	我是中文句子
Latin American countries save 18% of GDP, on average, compared to 30% in fast-growing East Asia.	我是中文句子
As a result, every time investment picks up in Latin America, it has to be financed with loans from abroad.	我是中文句子
Foreign investors are willing to live with the resulting current-account deficits, but only up to a point.	我是中文句子
Brazil was the most prominent among the Latin American economies under attack, but analysts worried about similar vulnerabilities elsewhere in the region.	我是中文句子
As a result, now, as in the recent past, whenever foreigners get jittery, financing and investment in Latin America are curtailed, and growth suffers.	我是中文句子
The scarcity of savings in the region reflects the weak incentives embedded in poorly designed tax and pension systems.	我是中文句子
But savings performance is also related to long-standing fiscal problems.	我是中文句子
The composition of government spending is also a problem.	我是中文句子
According to the same IADB report, investment accounts for only 16% of fiscal outlays, less than half the share in emerging Asia.	我是中文句子
So Latin America suffers from a longstanding infrastructure deficit, which acts as a drag on growth.	我是中文句子
Even abundant domestic savings in the future would not guarantee higher investment.	我是中文句子
Firms’ eagerness to invest depends on how much additional output they can get out of that investment, and recent productivity growth in Latin America – as in the US – has been disappointing.	我是中文句子
Lagging productivity has many causes, but one is the failure to diversify local economic structures.	我是中文句子
That is yet another big difference between the region and East Asia.	我是中文句子
So, can Latin American economies keep growing once commodity prices and world interest rates edge back toward normality?	我是中文句子
We in the region hope they can.	我是中文句子
But a return to stagnation is also a possibility – one that can be minimized only if policymakers acknowledge it and begin taking preventive action right away.	我是中文句子
The Humanities Crisis	我是中文句子
NEW YORK – A striking symmetry is emerging in debates about the future of higher education around the world.	我是中文句子
This fear has led to the narrowing of the concept of education to mean the acquisition of practical skills.	我是中文句子
This fear is manifesting itself in an incipient effort to expand education to include the cultivation of feeling and imagination.	我是中文句子
Both movements are rooted in economic concerns.	我是中文句子
Hong Kong University, for example, has extended its undergraduate programs from three years to four.	我是中文句子
But such a narrow, economics-based view fails to account for the larger questions of value that societies worldwide are facing.	我是中文句子
For example:	我是中文句子
·         How can the imperative of economic development be reconciled with the need to limit climate change?	我是中文句子
·         What does national sovereignty mean in a world where diseases, pollutants, and terrorists cross national borders at will?	我是中文句子
·         Are there universal human rights that transcend conflicting claims of particular cultural traditions?	我是中文句子
·         What are a country’s obligations to refugees fleeing from persecution, poverty, or strife elsewhere?	我是中文句子
·         How should we balance individual liberty and collective security?	我是中文句子
In answering such questions, advances in science and technology (for example, new methods of energy production, surveillance, or online learning) will have a key role to play.	我是中文句子
But moral and ethical questions never yield fully to technical solutions; they also require an understanding of humanity’s social and cultural heritage.	我是中文句子
Science can help us to attain the life we want, but it cannot teach us what kind of life is worth wanting.	我是中文句子
In short, each side in the current education debate is half right.	我是中文句子
Fortunately, promising new models for making education more coherent and capacious are emerging.	我是中文句子
Yale University and the National University of Singapore have worked together to establish Yale-NUS, Singapore’s first liberal arts college.	我是中文句子
Led by a literary scholar and an astronomer, this new residential college aims to break down interdisciplinary boundaries and enable students to learn from one another.	我是中文句子
Similar efforts have been underway for years in the US.	我是中文句子
Unfortunately, such programs largely lack the visibility and influence needed to shape educational reform.	我是中文句子
It is time to seek out best practices that bridge this putative divide, and scale them up.	我是中文句子
In the important work of adapting educational institutions for the future, we must not lose sight of their core mission as articulated in the past.	我是中文句子
This is an aspiration that should be renewed for every generation.	我是中文句子
Piketty with Chinese Characteristics	我是中文句子
Of course, a large share of China’s population has gained from three decades of unprecedentedly rapid GDP growth.	我是中文句子
As the investment rate rose to almost half of GDP, the share of consumption fell to as little as a third.	我是中文句子
The same group has also benefited from the leverage implied by strong credit growth.	我是中文句子
In fact, while the rise of China and other emerging economies has reduced inequality among countries, domestic inequality has risen almost everywhere.	我是中文句子
The Piketty framework highlights several drivers of this trend.	我是中文句子
The global financial system reinforces this concentration, with negative real interest rates promoting financial repression on household savings.	我是中文句子
Given that banks prefer lending to larger enterprises and borrowers with collateral, small and medium-size enterprises struggle to gain access to credit and capital.	我是中文句子
In many emerging economies, including China, widespread fear of insufficient retirement income is fueling high household saving rates.	我是中文句子
Economists largely agree that this trend toward inequality is unsustainable, but they differ on how to curb it.	我是中文句子
Those on the right argue for more market-based innovation to create wealth, while those on the left argue for more state intervention.	我是中文句子
China needs to strike a balance between policy-supported stability and market-driven progress.	我是中文句子
In particular, policy and institutional factors have led to the underpricing of key resources, generating significant risk.	我是中文句子
The vast workforce has driven down the price of labor, impeding the transition to a high-income, domestic-consumption-driven growth model.	我是中文句子
Moreover, policies aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate and keeping interest rates low have caused capital and risk to become undervalued in large projects.	我是中文句子
Given property’s role as the main form of collateral for bank loans, financial risk has risen sharply.	我是中文句子
The government is now attempting to mitigate the risks that investors and local governments have assumed by allowing more interest- and exchange-rate flexibility.	我是中文句子
In order to ensure long-term social stability, China must promote inclusive wealth creation, for example, by establishing strong incentives for innovation.	我是中文句子
Another challenge lies in the decline in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index from its 2007 peak of 6,000 to around 2,000 today.	我是中文句子
With financial assets failing to bring adequate dividends or capital appreciation, many investors have switched to real estate as a hedge against inflation.	我是中文句子
China’s leaders are already working to guide the transition to a growth model driven by domestic consumption and higher-value-added production.	我是中文句子
But the challenge is more complex than that.	我是中文句子
To succeed would fulfill the Chinese Dream.	我是中文句子
Failure would mean that inequality would continue to fester worldwide.	我是中文句子
China’s Subprime Risks	我是中文句子
HONG KONG – It is now widely accepted that the recent global financial crisis was actually a balance-sheet crisis.	我是中文句子
Long periods of negative interest rates facilitated the unsustainable financing of asset purchases, with high-risk mortgages weakening national balance sheets.	我是中文句子
When liquidity in the key interbank markets dried up, the fragilities were exposed – with devastating consequences.	我是中文句子
Is there any merit to such forecasts?	我是中文句子
The concern is China’s rapidly increasing domestic debt, which currently stands at 215% of GDP.	我是中文句子
The debt held by non-financial enterprises amounts to 113% of GDP in China, compared to 72% in the US and 99% in Japan.	我是中文句子
But, given that the largest enterprises are either state-owned or local-government entities, their debts are essentially domestic sovereign obligations.	我是中文句子
Of course, China’s leaders will also need to pursue major fiscal reforms, including improved revenue-sharing between central and local governments.	我是中文句子
From 2007 to 2011, China’s money supply increased by 116%, whereas its foreign-exchange reserves grew by 180%.	我是中文句子
The excess was mopped up through statutory reserve requirements amounting to as much as 20% of bank deposits.	我是中文句子
This highlights two fundamental structural imperatives.	我是中文句子
First, large SOEs and local governments must be discouraged from over-investing, which undermines the rate of return.	我是中文句子
Second, more capital must be channeled toward SMEs and faster-growing regions, which are more likely to generate jobs and innovation.	我是中文句子
In other words, interest-rate reforms must be pursued alongside capital-market reforms that boost access to credit by the more productive sectors.	我是中文句子
Unlike the US Federal Reserve, it has not purchased subprime mortgages.	我是中文句子
The Dual Dragon	我是中文句子
HONG KONG – China’s economy is again facing the specter of a hard landing.	我是中文句子
And additional risks seem to lurk at almost every turn.	我是中文句子
Any strategy for mitigating the threat of a sharp slowdown must account for the dual nature of China’s economy.	我是中文句子
On the one hand, Chinese cities are becoming increasingly modern and globally engaged.	我是中文句子
On the other hand, half of China’s population remains rural, deriving a large share of income from agricultural activities.	我是中文句子
This duality has positive implications for China’s economic prospects.	我是中文句子
Local-government liabilities and non-performing loans are thus a domestic problem, whose only real spillover effects would stem from debt-redistribution efforts.	我是中文句子
Achieving this will require that China address another, more problematic dualism in its economy: the two-tiered credit system.	我是中文句子
With the formal banking sector subject to strict controls on deposit and lending rates, large state-owned enterprises and local governments were the only entities that could access enough credit to finance large-scale investments like infrastructure projects.	我是中文句子
This shift – together with the declining current-account surplus and massive infrastructure investment – put upward pressure on domestic interest rates.	我是中文句子
While the authorities could keep official interest rates under control, unofficial rates began to rise irrepressibly, fueling the rapid expansion of shadow banking.	我是中文句子
But rapidly rising property prices in some of China’s less dynamic cities are leading to outward labor migration, effectively turning them into shiny ghost towns.	我是中文句子
In pursuing interest-rate liberalization, China must unify formal and informal rates, which requires action at both the macro and micro levels.	我是中文句子
Furthermore, relying largely on tightening credit to limit risks also raises new complications.	我是中文句子
As of the end of 2012, shadow banking accounted for 24% of total credit, at interest rates 10-15% higher than official rates.	我是中文句子
This has hurt the real economy by increasing the cost of capital.	我是中文句子
Harnessing China’s Competitive Streak	我是中文句子
Can it be done?	我是中文句子
The implementation of a competition framework for enterprises is a work in progress.	我是中文句子
But managing competition in a market that has three major players – state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and domestic and foreign private companies – is a complex task.	我是中文句子
Private-sector firms are frustrated with the privileges that SOEs enjoy, while foreign-owned enterprises complain that they are at a disadvantage vis-à-vis domestic companies.	我是中文句子
The management of inter-sectoral competition is even more complicated.	我是中文句子
The challenge is intensified by technological advances and regulatory arbitrage.	我是中文句子
E-commerce platforms like Alibaba have not only breached banks’ payment business; they have also begun to offer wealth-management products.	我是中文句子
And regulatory arbitrage has fueled the emergence of shadow banking, which is competing actively with traditional financial institutions for wealth-management and lending business.	我是中文句子
For example, overlapping regulation by at least five agencies and ministries has delayed the development of China’s bond market considerably.	我是中文句子
The best example of healthy competition in China is that which occurs among cities.	我是中文句子
China has 287 prefecture-level cities, with a median population of 3.7 million and median per capita GDP of $5,800.	我是中文句子
These cities hold the key to the ability of China as a whole to avoid the middle-income trap.	我是中文句子
At the same time, in order to preserve the system’s stability and integrity, these efforts were accompanied by the centralization of fiscal authority and certain oversight powers.	我是中文句子
This balance between horizontal competition and vertical regulation was critical to promoting growth and dynamism in Chinese cities.	我是中文句子
But the balance has been far from ideal.	我是中文句子
Indeed, competition among cities – intensified by the large role that municipal-level GDP growth plays in determining local officials’ career paths – went too far, creating destabilizing imbalances.	我是中文句子
Competition-fueled growth propelled China’s emergence as the world’s second-largest economy.	我是中文句子
But it is unsustainable.	我是中文句子
The imperative now is to rebalance competition to address the negative externalities of state and market activities that harm citizens’ interests.	我是中文句子
The central government’s recent removal of certain judicial powers from local governments, thereby strengthening protection of property rights, is an important step in this direction.	我是中文句子
But it is not enough.	我是中文句子
No competition can work without clear, fair rules.	我是中文句子
That is the real challenge facing China’s leaders today.	我是中文句子
If they succeed, a high-income China will be only a matter of time.	我是中文句子
Re-Governing China	我是中文句子
The question is whether the government can follow through on its ambitious reform and development plans.	我是中文句子
Consider the effort last summer to assess the government’s financial condition.	我是中文句子
Clearly, public-sector governance in China is radically different from that in the West, where the rule of law, democratic elections, and free markets are structural norms.	我是中文句子
One way to appreciate the complexity of China’s governance ecosystem is to examine the matrix of relationships among institutions, the tiao tiao kuai kuai – literally, “lines and pieces.”	我是中文句子
Kuai kuai refers to the lateral, highly competitive relationships among regional entities, to which the central government delegates a certain amount of autonomy.	我是中文句子
In order to achieve genuine stability, China’s leaders must strike a delicate balance between tiao tiao control and kuai kuai autonomy.	我是中文句子
The government is then forced to re-impose central control abruptly, bringing about a sudden stop.	我是中文句子
If China’s economy were a car, the country’s leaders would always be either flooring the accelerator or slamming on the brakes.	我是中文句子
With its latest set of reforms, China’s government is attempting finally to fine-tune its approach.	我是中文句子
This effort to ease unnecessary constraints on regional entities will lead to market and institutional innovations.	我是中文句子
These innovations, together with increased transparency and the implementation of cutting-edge technologies, are likely to reduce rent-seeking and corruption, while boosting productivity and employment significantly.	我是中文句子
Indeed, coping with global competition for markets, resources, talent, and respect will require a two-way interaction between Chinese and global governance systems.	我是中文句子
This process is only beginning, but it is off to a strong start.	我是中文句子
Great Cities and Ghost Towns	我是中文句子
But this view underestimates the inevitability – indeed, the necessity – of such challenges on the path to development.	我是中文句子
The United States had ghost towns and local bank busts once it began investing in railways, mining, and industrialization in the mid-nineteenth century.	我是中文句子
